1
00:00:10,502 --> 00:00:14,167
Take this pink ribbon
off my eyes

2
00:00:14,297 --> 00:00:18,591
I'm exposed
and it's no big surprise

3
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,586
Don't you think I know
exactly where I stand

4
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:28,017
This world is forcing me
to hold your hand

5
00:00:28,145 --> 00:00:31,763
'Cause I'm just a girl
Well, little old me

6
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:36,477
Well don't let me
out of your sight

7
00:00:36,611 --> 00:00:38,984
Oh, I'm just a girl

8
00:00:39,114 --> 00:00:41,071
All pretty and petite

9
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:45,826
So don't let me
have any rights

10
00:00:45,954 --> 00:00:51,161
Oh I've had it
up to here

11
00:00:54,838 --> 00:00:58,587
The moment that
I step outside

12
00:00:58,717 --> 00:01:02,845
So many reasons
for me to run and hide

13
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:07,348
I can't do the little things
I hold so dear

14
00:01:07,476 --> 00:01:12,387
'Cause it's all those
little things that I fear

15
00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:16,567
'Cause I'm just a girl
I'd rather not be

16
00:01:16,693 --> 00:01:21,154
'Cause they won't let me
drive late at night

17
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:25,445
Oh, I'm just a girl
Guess I'm some kind of freak

18
00:01:25,577 --> 00:01:30,405
'Cause they all sit
and stare with their eyes

19
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,879
Oh, am I making myself clear

20
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:43,796
I'm just a girl

21
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:47,464
I'm just a girl in the world

22
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:51,549
- How much is this, Lori?
- It's very expensive.

23
00:01:51,686 --> 00:01:53,644
It's very expensive.

24
00:01:53,772 --> 00:01:56,227
Look, I got money
to spend in here.

25
00:01:56,358 --> 00:02:01,234
I don't think we have anything for you.
You're obviously in the wrong place.

26
00:02:01,363 --> 00:02:03,402
Please leave.

27
00:02:03,532 --> 00:02:07,232
You know, even though we've watched
"Pretty Woman" like 36 times...

28
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:11,153
- I never get tired of making fun of it.
- Oh, I know.

29
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:16,331
Aww, poor thing. Look!
They won't let her shop.

30
00:02:16,461 --> 00:02:20,459
Yeah, like those salesgirls in Beverly
Hills aren't bigger whores than she is.

31
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,500
I know!

32
00:02:24,094 --> 00:02:27,344
Oh, my God, listen to that
sad, sad music as she leaves.

33
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,055
It's like, boo-hoo. Uhh.

34
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:34,719
But it is actually
kind of sad.

35
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,067
Anything you see here we can do, by the
way. Get ready to have some fun, okay?

36
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,317
- Okay.
- Mary Pat, Mary Kate,
Mary Frances, Tovah.

37
00:02:43,447 --> 00:02:46,816
- Let's see it, come on!
Let's see the outfit.
- How divine!

38
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,655
Exactly how obscene--

39
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:53,914
I just get really happy
when they finally let her shop.

40
00:02:55,917 --> 00:02:57,827
Okay, so I have
nothing to wear.

41
00:02:57,961 --> 00:03:00,630
We don't even have time to make
anything new before we go out.

42
00:03:00,756 --> 00:03:02,997
Well, what about this?

43
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:07,676
- Did you lose weight?
- Actually, I have been trying
this new fat-free diet I invented.

44
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:11,719
All I've had to eat for the past
six days are Gummi Bears,
jelly beans, and candy corns.

45
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:15,433
God, I wish I had
your discipline.

46
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,267
- This is it
- Work this

47
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,521
- Diddy-bum diddy-bum pow
- Here it is

48
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,272
I can't believe
how cute I look!

49
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:27,448
I know! You know what? This is like
the cutest we've ever looked.

50
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:31,157
Oh, it's definitely the cutest.
Don't you love how we can just
say that to each other...

51
00:03:31,286 --> 00:03:33,742
- and we know that we're
not being conceited?
- Oh, I know.

52
00:03:33,872 --> 00:03:36,873
No, we're just
being honest.

53
00:03:38,126 --> 00:03:40,498
- Be my lover, Want to be my lover
- Lover

54
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:47,340
Go ahead and take your time
Boy you got to feel secure

55
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:50,470
Before I make you mine
Baby you have to be sure

56
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:54,013
You want to be my lover
Want to be my lover

57
00:03:54,142 --> 00:03:57,760
God. I hope some cute guys get here
tonight. They were cute last night.

58
00:03:57,896 --> 00:04:01,146
- Oh, they were cute.
- Really cute!
- Oh!

59
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:04,110
- Hey, Michele! Romy!
- We'll take two Diet Cokes?

60
00:04:04,236 --> 00:04:07,355
Right, with extra cherries.
Don't move. I'll be right back.

61
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:12,732
Okay. I have the yuckiest taste
in my mouth from those taquitos.

62
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:15,621
- Eeew.
- I hope I don't get indigestion.

63
00:04:15,747 --> 00:04:19,448
Hey, remember that time I barfed
from bad Mexican food? It was so gross.

64
00:04:19,584 --> 00:04:23,582
- Oh, my God, I hate
throwing up in public.
- Me too! Ooh.

65
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,800
I can't believe it. There are
absolutely no guys here tonight.

66
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:37,258
I know. None.

67
00:04:37,394 --> 00:04:40,063
Come on, Michele, let's just
go dance with ourselves.

68
00:04:40,188 --> 00:04:42,098
Okay.

69
00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:44,106
Put your hands in the air

70
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:46,939
'Cause there's a party over here
So grab yourself a beer

71
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,356
And we could
get on with the world

72
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,358
Swear to God.
Sometimes I wish I were a lesbian.

73
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:57,863
You want to try and have sex sometime?
Just to see if we are?

74
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:02,411
What? Yeah, right, Michele.
Just the thought of having sex
with another woman creeps me out.

75
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,167
But if we're not married by
the time we're 30, ask me again.

76
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,051
- Okay.
- Tell me can you feel the

77
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,301
Masked girls coming
with the fever, fever, fever

78
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,759
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Staying alive, staying alive

79
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:22,222
Ahh-ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Staying alive, staying alive

80
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:26,768
Ahh-ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Staying alive, staying alive

81
00:05:26,902 --> 00:05:31,564
Ahh-ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Staying alive, staying alive

82
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:35,743
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Staying alive, staying alive

83
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:38,360
- Ahh-ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
- Two-four-three.

84
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:42,577
- Staying alive
- Two-four-three.

85
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,998
Two-four-three.

86
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,299
Two, four, three.

87
00:05:51,843 --> 00:05:54,678
Two, four, three.

88
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:59,431
Service.
Number 243.

89
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,433
It's beautiful.
Is that real wood?

90
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,554
During this century, boys.

91
00:06:07,984 --> 00:06:11,982
Come on, Ramon. Quit jerking off
and bring the car around.

92
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:23,785
- It's about time.
- Mm. Romy!

93
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,704
You are looking hot today.

94
00:06:26,837 --> 00:06:29,956
Yeah. That's because
I'm sweating like a pig in here.

95
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,842
Well, the air conditioning is
working in the service office.

96
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:38,128
You might want to come by
and, uh, cool off later?

97
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:41,385
Yeah, Ramon.
That'll happen.

98
00:06:41,518 --> 00:06:45,053
Sorry, ma'am.
He is such an asshole.

99
00:06:45,188 --> 00:06:47,940
Mm.

100
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:50,736
- I'm in a hurry.
- Well--

101
00:06:50,861 --> 00:06:56,484
I'm going as fast as I can,
Ms Mooney. Heather.

102
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,823
Heather Mooney?

103
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:01,110
From Sagebrush High
in Tucson?

104
00:07:03,165 --> 00:07:06,664
- Yeah?
- It's Romy!

105
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,165
- Romy White!
- You're shitting me.

106
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:12,795
No, this is so weird. I didn't
know you were living in L.A.

107
00:07:12,924 --> 00:07:16,340
Well, now that you know, will
we be getting together a lot?

108
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,634
So, God!
You're driving a new Jaguar?

109
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:24,222
- What do you do?
- Ever hear of Lady Fair cigarettes?

110
00:07:24,352 --> 00:07:28,302
- The ones that burn down real fast?
- "Twice the taste, in half the
time, for the gal on the go"?

111
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,603
I invented the
quick-burning paper.

112
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,694
Wow!

113
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:38,444
- You going to the reunion?
- What reunion?

114
00:07:38,575 --> 00:07:41,362
Our ten-year high school
reunion in Tucson?

115
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:45,029
You're kidding me. It's been
ten years since high school?

116
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:49,791
- God. Where have I been?
- I'm stumped. Where?

117
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,371
- Anyway, are you going?
- I'd rather put this out in my ass.

118
00:07:55,217 --> 00:07:57,423
I wonder why we didn't
get an invitation.

119
00:07:57,552 --> 00:08:00,222
I mean, I'm sure Michele would
have told me if she got one.

120
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:02,505
- Michele Weinberger?
- Mm-hmm.

121
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:06,722
- Do you live with Michele Weinberger?
- Yeah.

122
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:11,811
I just thought maybe she'd
be married to Sandy by now.

123
00:08:11,942 --> 00:08:14,480
- Sandy Frink?
- Yes, Sandy Frink.

124
00:08:14,611 --> 00:08:16,817
He could barely contain his erection
every time she was around.

125
00:08:16,947 --> 00:08:19,983
Why do you think he always
carried that huge notebook?

126
00:08:20,117 --> 00:08:23,118
The Frink-a-zoid
and Michele, I am sure.

127
00:08:23,245 --> 00:08:27,194
Besides, didn't you have a thing
for Sandy in high school?

128
00:08:27,332 --> 00:08:32,457
I did not have a "thing." I did not have
a "thing." I did not have a "thing."

129
00:08:32,587 --> 00:08:34,545
I was very much
in love with him.

130
00:08:34,673 --> 00:08:36,998
Very much in love,
and there's a difference.

131
00:08:38,593 --> 00:08:41,594
There's a difference.

132
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:43,595
There's a difference.

133
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,932
I have to go now.

134
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:54,606
Well! I guess I won't be
seeing you at the reunion.

135
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,976
- But I'll tell everyone you said "hi."
- Why don't you tell everyone...

136
00:08:57,112 --> 00:09:00,647
I said to go fuck themselves, for making
my teen years a living hell?

137
00:09:00,782 --> 00:09:02,407
Oh, yeah, right!

138
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,705
Finally--

139
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:14,669
Michele. You will never guess
who I just ran into.

140
00:09:16,965 --> 00:09:20,630
- God, I cannot believe
it's already been ten years.
- I know.

141
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:23,252
- Oh.
- You know...
- There she is.

142
00:09:23,388 --> 00:09:26,888
Oh! God,
she was so weird.

143
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:30,220
- She still is.
- Why was she, like, always
going behind that building?

144
00:09:38,487 --> 00:09:42,319
It was long ago

145
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:46,316
Seems like yesterday

146
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:50,285
Saw you standing in the rain

147
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:54,247
- Then I heard you say
- Got a light?

148
00:09:54,378 --> 00:09:58,245
- I want your love
But it comes out wrong
- Thank you.

149
00:09:58,382 --> 00:10:02,426
- I want to live, but I don't belong
- Thank you! Thank you,
I really appreciate that...

150
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:05,838
because I'm not a human being
or anything, you pathetic turd!

151
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:13,102
Blood and roses
Blood and roses

152
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,681
Blood and roses

153
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:21,775
- Roses, roses
- There should be a cigarette
you could smoke all the way
through between classes.

154
00:10:21,905 --> 00:10:24,574
What a waste.

155
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:27,866
- Okay.
- Find us.
- Oh. Okay.

156
00:10:29,788 --> 00:10:31,994
Oh, my God, do you remember
what a big controversy it was...

157
00:10:32,124 --> 00:10:35,706
for us to have our
picture taken together?

158
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:39,703
Yeah, well, Danny Weller, like,
"lodged the complaint," and, you know--

159
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,209
'Cause, "alphabetically,
he's supposed to be between us."

160
00:10:45,053 --> 00:10:48,339
And then we said, "Okay, Danny.
If you want to be between us...

161
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:51,474
you can come to Michele's house on
Friday night, and we'll be waiting."

162
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:53,677
That's right. He came over and
we're like, "Danny, it was a joke."

163
00:10:53,812 --> 00:10:56,517
I know! And then we turned
the sprinklers on him!

164
00:10:58,608 --> 00:11:02,476
Oh, my God.
Didn't he die?

165
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,154
- I think so.
- Yeah.

166
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:12,487
- Oh, my God. Michele.
Look at the "A" group.
- Mm-hmm.

167
00:11:12,622 --> 00:11:15,078
Christie Masters,
Kelly Possenger...

168
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,497
Lisa Luder
and Cheryl Quick.

169
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:22,416
So, who would you say
was in the "B" group?

170
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:25,550
Oh. The drama crowd. You know,
like Casey Degan and Mark Black.

171
00:11:25,677 --> 00:11:30,054
- Uh-huh. God, I had the hugest
crush on Casey. 'Member?
- Oh, yeah.

172
00:11:30,182 --> 00:11:32,055
God, I wonder why
he never liked me.

173
00:11:33,643 --> 00:11:36,680
Young man, there's
no need to feel down

174
00:11:36,813 --> 00:11:38,770
I said, young man--

175
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:41,437
So, what group would
you say we were in?

176
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:44,106
Well, we definitely
weren't in the "A" group.

177
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:47,238
But you know what? We weren't
really in the "B" group, either.

178
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:49,488
Okay, we weren't in
the "C" group, were we?

179
00:11:49,618 --> 00:11:53,450
What? Oh, no. Michele, come on.
I mean, that was like,
all the honour students and like...

180
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,201
the rejects; you know, like
Sandy Frink and Heather Mooney.

181
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:59,702
- Eeew, look at them.
- We were definitely not in that group.

182
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:02,292
- Ecch.
- She blinded me with Science

183
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:06,467
Michele! Oh, Michele.
Over here!

184
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,467
Want me to get your
huge notebook for you?

185
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:12,213
Oh! Heather! I want to
take another picture of you and
Sandy for the yearbook and--

186
00:12:12,349 --> 00:12:14,306
Oh! I want to
interview you too...

187
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:17,008
because I think it would make a really
interesting article for the "Roundup."

188
00:12:17,145 --> 00:12:19,815
Ohh, Toby! Fuck off.

189
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,312
Okay. But can I take
a picture of you first?

190
00:12:24,486 --> 00:12:26,479
So, Romy, what group
were we in?

191
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:30,693
Well, you know, I'm not sure that
we were really in any group.

192
00:12:30,826 --> 00:12:33,661
I think maybe we were
more like loners.

193
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,081
- Oh, my God! There we are!
- Yeah, and alone. Look.

194
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:41,542
You know, even though I had
to wear that stupid back brace,
and you were kind of fat...

195
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,544
we were still totally
cutting edge.

196
00:12:43,672 --> 00:12:46,792
- I love it when it's hamburger day.
- Uh-huh.

197
00:12:46,925 --> 00:12:51,338
Okay, smile! Great!
Thanks a lot!

198
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:54,674
- Can I take your picture?
- Oh, please.
- Hello, girls.

199
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:57,809
Don't forget, you have
detention after school today.

200
00:12:57,936 --> 00:13:01,981
- Oh, we won't, Mr Lish.
- Yeah, we're really
looking forward to it.

201
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:10,857
- God!
- Can you believe he just got married?

202
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:16,068
- Like, how desperate is she?
- I know, it's like:
"Hi. This is my husband.

203
00:13:16,204 --> 00:13:19,573
He dissects crayfish, but he
has a really good personality."

204
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:24,121
He's the kind of man
that I desire

205
00:13:24,254 --> 00:13:28,750
Sets the summer sun
on fire

206
00:13:28,884 --> 00:13:32,928
- I want candy
- Oh, my God.

207
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:37,882
- I want candy
- Michele. Billy Christianson.

208
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:41,469
- Oh, he's so cute.
- He is cute.
- Really cute.

209
00:13:45,817 --> 00:13:50,111
- Hey
- Hi, Billy.
- Hey

210
00:13:50,238 --> 00:13:52,231
Hey

211
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,323
Hey

212
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:56,823
- Hey
- Ow! Billy!

213
00:13:56,953 --> 00:14:00,737
Oh, Billy, gosh,
you're so slimy.

214
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:04,373
I cannot believe he's
with Christie Masters.

215
00:14:04,503 --> 00:14:07,420
I know. She is, like,
so transparent.

216
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,540
Did you hear her report
in Miss Weigatt's class?

217
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:13,838
She actually thinks she's going to be a
TV anchorwoman. What a "deludanoid."

218
00:14:16,807 --> 00:14:19,428
Those weirdos are
staring at us again.

219
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:22,513
- They're obsessed with us.
- Look at what they're wearing.

220
00:14:22,646 --> 00:14:25,184
Where do you even get
outfits that hideous?

221
00:14:25,315 --> 00:14:28,233
They made them in Home Ec
from their own patterns.

222
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,898
Actually, I think
they're semi-interesting.

223
00:14:35,158 --> 00:14:39,238
In a freakish, off-putting
sort of way. Never mind.

224
00:14:39,371 --> 00:14:41,245
- Christie.
- Uh.
- Come on, I'm hungry.

225
00:14:41,373 --> 00:14:44,208
No, Billy. Wait.
I want to have some fun.

226
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:47,252
Lisa, give me the bag.

227
00:14:51,174 --> 00:14:55,421
Here you go.
You are so bad.

228
00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:00,425
- What? What?
- She is out of control.

229
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:07,728
Michele? Christie Masters
is coming over here.

230
00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:11,725
- Wow. She never comes over.
- Okay, just act cool.

231
00:15:15,866 --> 00:15:19,235
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, Christie.

232
00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:24,197
- So. You girls going to try out
for the spring musical?
- Us?

233
00:15:24,332 --> 00:15:28,829
Yeah, you should.
It'll be fun.

234
00:15:30,714 --> 00:15:35,008
- Okay. Why not?
- Yeah. So, um, what
musical are they doing?

235
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:38,171
- "The Music Man."
- You're kidding!

236
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:41,840
Oh, the Wells Fargo wagon
Is a-coming down the street

237
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:44,810
I love "The Music Man."

238
00:15:44,936 --> 00:15:49,682
Okay. Can I have
the rest of this?

239
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:53,351
Um, w--

240
00:15:53,487 --> 00:15:56,357
Mm. It's good.

241
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,528
See you!

242
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:05,948
She can be really nice
when she wants to be.

243
00:16:07,084 --> 00:16:08,957
Michele!

244
00:16:11,213 --> 00:16:15,875
- Uh-oh. Don't look now.
Here come the Frink-a-zoid.
- Oh, God! He is such a geek!

245
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:20,221
Hi, Michele. Gee, Michele,
you're looking really lovely today.

246
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:24,518
Okay. See you in Biology.

247
00:16:26,603 --> 00:16:29,853
I-l-l thought I ought
to tell you, Michele, that...

248
00:16:29,981 --> 00:16:34,478
Christie Masters stuck
magnets on your back.

249
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:36,520
- What?
- She stuck--

250
00:16:36,655 --> 00:16:38,731
Michele, you do have
magnets on your back!

251
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:41,902
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

252
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:44,407
Oh, my God.
Help me.

253
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:46,411
Oh, my God.

254
00:16:49,084 --> 00:16:51,705
Oh, don't let them see you get upset.
That's what they want.

255
00:16:52,587 --> 00:16:56,253
Oh, my God.

256
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:59,218
- Hey!
- I'm pretending you just
did something hilarious.

257
00:16:59,344 --> 00:17:01,586
Now, you laugh at me.
Come on, do it.

258
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:18,314
God, that was so rude. I mean, you
couldn't help it if you had scoliosis.

259
00:17:18,447 --> 00:17:23,689
I know. And what a bitch, taking
your hamburger. I mean, what was that?

260
00:17:24,494 --> 00:17:28,706
God, remember the prom?
You got so thin by then.

261
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:34,377
Oh, I know. I was so lucky,
getting mono. That was, like,
the best diet ever.

262
00:17:34,504 --> 00:17:38,336
I wonder, if I had gotten
my brace off sooner, if
somebody would have invited me.

263
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:40,673
I mean, other
than Sandy Frink.

264
00:17:40,802 --> 00:17:42,961
Well, nobody
invited me either.

265
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:48,435
Well, at least we looked fantastic,
and that is the most important thing.

266
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,269
- We were cool on craze
- Oh, gee. Nice outfits. Really.

267
00:17:53,398 --> 00:17:57,562
- When l, you
- Oh, look, it's the Madonna twins.
- And everyone we knew

268
00:17:57,694 --> 00:18:02,689
Could believe, do, and share
in what was true, Oh, I said

269
00:18:02,824 --> 00:18:05,494
Okay, this is so typical.
Of course, we're like the only ones...

270
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:07,742
who don't look like
we're going to a hoedown.

271
00:18:07,871 --> 00:18:11,038
-Oh, I know. This town is like so unhip.
-Ecch.

272
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:14,749
- I can't wait till we move to L.A.
- Me too!

273
00:18:14,878 --> 00:18:18,496
Everything's going to happen for us there,
Michele, and we'll never look back.

274
00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:21,419
- Okay.
- Dance hall days

275
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:27,807
- Dance hall days
- Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

276
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:30,091
That hurt.
But it looked really good.

277
00:18:30,227 --> 00:18:32,184
Dance hall days

278
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:34,186
Oh, everybody!

279
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:36,686
- Dance hall, dance hall days
- Okay, everyone.

280
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:40,565
Uh, it's the moment
we've all been waiting for.

281
00:18:40,695 --> 00:18:44,361
It's time to announce
the king and queen of the prom.

282
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:47,575
- Ahh!
- And the winners are...

283
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:55,415
Billy Christianson
and Christie Masters!

284
00:18:55,544 --> 00:18:58,913
Ohh! Ohh!

285
00:18:59,047 --> 00:19:02,499
- Duh.
- Oh, it's me!

286
00:19:05,762 --> 00:19:07,921
Boo-hoo!
I'm so surprised!

287
00:19:08,056 --> 00:19:10,345
Thank you. Thank you.

288
00:19:10,475 --> 00:19:12,883
God, Billy looks
cute in his tux.

289
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,511
- He does look cute.
- Really cute.

290
00:19:18,775 --> 00:19:23,022
Do you think, since it's
the last night of school and
I might never see him again...

291
00:19:23,155 --> 00:19:26,405
that maybe he would
dance with me?

292
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:29,238
I bet he would.
I mean, it's senior prom.

293
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,741
Nobody's going to say "no"
to anyone tonight.

294
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:46,251
Michele, since this is the
last night of school and all...

295
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:49,387
would you care
to dance with me once?

296
00:19:49,514 --> 00:19:51,673
No.

297
00:19:53,852 --> 00:19:57,435
I'll dance with you.

298
00:19:57,564 --> 00:20:01,941
Nah. It's no fun unless
you really love the person.

299
00:20:04,362 --> 00:20:07,233
Thanks, anyway.

300
00:20:07,365 --> 00:20:09,987
Okay. Who can name the capitals
of all the 50 states?

301
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:13,119
Okay, Toby. Fuck off.

302
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:17,540
Heather! Can't you be
a little bit more sensitive?

303
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:21,617
Me? Me? Me be
more sensitive?

304
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:23,629
You are a jerk-off!

305
00:20:23,757 --> 00:20:27,837
Another kiss
is what it takes

306
00:20:27,969 --> 00:20:29,962
- Albuquerque.
- You can't sleep

307
00:20:30,097 --> 00:20:31,970
- You can't eat
- Albany.

308
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:34,138
There's no doubt

309
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:36,260
You're in deep

310
00:20:36,395 --> 00:20:40,523
Your throat is tight
You can't breathe

311
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:45,145
Another kiss is all you need
Whoa-oh-ohh

312
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:48,564
- Why are you tormenting me?
- You like to think
you're immune to the stuff

313
00:20:48,698 --> 00:20:53,906
- Why don't you go fuck a sheep
or your sister or yourself?
- Oh, yeah

314
00:20:54,037 --> 00:20:56,528
Brain-dead
redneck asshole!

315
00:20:56,665 --> 00:20:59,915
Can't get enough
You know you're going to have to face it

316
00:21:00,043 --> 00:21:04,041
You're addicted to love
You see the signs

317
00:21:04,172 --> 00:21:06,379
But you can't read

318
00:21:06,508 --> 00:21:10,588
You're running at
a different speed

319
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:14,932
Your heart beats
in double time

320
00:21:15,058 --> 00:21:17,265
- Another kiss
- Um, Billy?

321
00:21:17,394 --> 00:21:19,268
- And you'll be mine
- Hi.

322
00:21:19,396 --> 00:21:23,725
- A one-track mind, you can't be saved
- Do you want to dance?

323
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:27,192
- Oblivion is all you crave
- I mean, it's just 'cause...

324
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,156
this song is,
like, so great.

325
00:21:30,282 --> 00:21:32,855
Mm. Never mind.

326
00:21:32,993 --> 00:21:36,196
Unless, you know,
you want to.

327
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:38,737
- Whoa, you like to think
- Yeah. I mean--

328
00:21:38,874 --> 00:21:40,866
- That you're immune to this stuff
- Y-Y-- Sure. Why not?

329
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:45,378
- Oh, yeah
- Really?
- Wh-- Um--

330
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:47,379
- It's closer to the truth
- Could you wait here?

331
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:50,177
- To say you can't get enough
- I-l-I'll be right back.
- Okay.

332
00:21:50,302 --> 00:21:54,169
- Okay.
- You know, you're going to have to face it
You're addicted to love

333
00:21:54,306 --> 00:21:58,256
Might as well face it
You're addicted to love

334
00:21:58,393 --> 00:22:00,267
- Might as well face it
- Hey, Christie.

335
00:22:00,395 --> 00:22:03,895
- You're addicted to love
- That Romy girl just asked
me to dance with her.

336
00:22:04,024 --> 00:22:07,475
- Might as well face it
- Oh, you're kidding me!
Oh, that's pathetic!

337
00:22:07,611 --> 00:22:11,905
- Might as well face it
- W-W-W-What should I do?

338
00:22:12,032 --> 00:22:14,108
Let me take care of this.

339
00:22:19,831 --> 00:22:23,081
- Michele?
- Oh, God. Okay, so what did he say?

340
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:26,164
- "Sure. Why not?"
- Oh, my God!

341
00:22:30,467 --> 00:22:33,384
- Thanks a lot, Romy.
- What?

342
00:22:33,512 --> 00:22:35,551
Thanks for stealing
my boyfriend.

343
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,014
- What are you talking about?
- Billy just broke up with me.

344
00:22:39,142 --> 00:22:41,812
Apparently he's had a crush on
you since Mr Roswell's class.

345
00:22:41,937 --> 00:22:46,433
And now that he knows that
you like him, he doesn't want
to "pretend" with me any more.

346
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:50,149
My life was perfect
and you've ruined it.

347
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:53,114
Go for it
Groove ahead

348
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,157
I swear to God, Christie,
I didn't even think he'd dance with me.

349
00:22:56,284 --> 00:23:00,116
- To whip it, Whip it good
- Wow. She is really P.O.'d.

350
00:23:00,247 --> 00:23:03,865
- This is so cool!
- Oh, I know.

351
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,045
You know what is so weird?
I had this dream, where Billy
was like, in love with me.

352
00:23:08,171 --> 00:23:12,003
And I mean, he was in
a wheelchair, but still, it's like
it's coming true or something!

353
00:23:12,134 --> 00:23:14,422
- Uh-huh.
- How's my hair?

354
00:23:14,553 --> 00:23:17,507
Perfect. Okay, Romy, you look so
good with blonde hair and black roots.

355
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:20,806
- It's like, not even funny.
- I have to say...

356
00:23:20,934 --> 00:23:24,801
this is turning out to be one of
the very best nights of my entire life.

357
00:23:24,938 --> 00:23:27,061
Yay, yay!

358
00:23:40,537 --> 00:23:44,950
Lying in my bed I hear
the clock tick

359
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:47,491
And think of you

360
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:50,581
Caught up in circles

361
00:23:50,714 --> 00:23:54,794
Confusion is nothing new

362
00:23:54,926 --> 00:23:58,675
Flashback to warm nights

363
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:02,174
Almost left behind

364
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:06,176
- Suitcase of memories
- You know, maybe he's, like,
passed out in the bathroom.

365
00:24:06,313 --> 00:24:08,187
- You want me to go check?
- Time after, Sometimes

366
00:24:08,315 --> 00:24:11,481
- You picture me
- He's not in the bathroom, Michele.

367
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:14,979
I'm walking too far ahead

368
00:24:15,113 --> 00:24:18,114
- I'll dance with you, Romy.
- You're calling to me

369
00:24:18,241 --> 00:24:22,239
- I can't hear what you've said
- Okay.
- Okay.

370
00:24:22,371 --> 00:24:26,451
Then you say "Go slow"

371
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:29,952
I fall behind

372
00:24:30,087 --> 00:24:32,838
The second hand unwinds

373
00:24:32,964 --> 00:24:37,626
If you're lost you can look
and you will find me

374
00:24:37,761 --> 00:24:40,169
Time after time

375
00:24:40,305 --> 00:24:44,884
If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting

376
00:24:45,018 --> 00:24:47,390
Time after time

377
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:52,266
If you're lost, you can look
and you will find me

378
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:54,892
Time after time

379
00:24:55,028 --> 00:24:59,655
- If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting
- I will be waiting

380
00:24:59,783 --> 00:25:03,282
Time after time

381
00:25:03,412 --> 00:25:05,285
Time after time

382
00:25:05,414 --> 00:25:07,572
We just waited and waited.

383
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:11,752
- God, I was such an idiot.
- But wait till he sees you now.

384
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:14,666
You are so much cuter
than you were in high school.

385
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:17,585
- I guess I'm cuter.
- Yeah!

386
00:25:17,718 --> 00:25:21,087
And look at the way we live.
I mean, just our lifestyle.

387
00:25:21,221 --> 00:25:24,471
You know, I mean, we live in L.A,
and they are still stuck in Tucson.

388
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:31,767
You know what, Michele?
You're right.

389
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:34,816
We are going to go back there
and blow them away.

390
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:42,321
Boy, there's a lot
of questions to answer.
Why do we have to fill these out?

391
00:25:42,451 --> 00:25:45,024
They want to know what we've been
doing for the past ten years.

392
00:25:45,162 --> 00:25:49,539
- Oh!
- Okay. Here we go.

393
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:51,623
- Ahh!
- "Name."

394
00:25:51,752 --> 00:25:55,203
- Ah! We're having so much fun already.
- Oh, I know!

395
00:25:55,338 --> 00:25:58,542
- I cannot wait for this reunion.
- Me too!

396
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:03,001
"Occupation."
Cashier.

397
00:26:03,138 --> 00:26:06,471
- Unemployed.
- No. Don't write that.

398
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,387
Um, okay, so your last job
was as a salesgirl?

399
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:14,098
- So say you're a freelance
fashion consultant.
- Ooh! Clever.

400
00:26:14,232 --> 00:26:17,352
"Relationship Status."
Married.

401
00:26:17,486 --> 00:26:20,985
- Nope.
- Engaged?
- No.

402
00:26:21,114 --> 00:26:24,898
- Living with someone?
- Should I say you?

403
00:26:25,035 --> 00:26:27,074
- I guess so.
- Okay.

404
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:34,918
- You know, Michele?
- Yeah?

405
00:26:35,045 --> 00:26:38,129
- Now that I'm looking at this...
- Uh-huh?

406
00:26:38,256 --> 00:26:41,423
our lives don't seem as
impressive as I thought.

407
00:26:41,551 --> 00:26:43,840
- They don't?
- Well, do you think it's impressive...

408
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,256
that we're still single, and we've
been living together for ten years...

409
00:26:47,391 --> 00:26:50,510
and I'm a cashier
and you're unemployed?

410
00:26:50,644 --> 00:26:52,886
Well, not super impressive.

411
00:26:53,021 --> 00:26:56,390
Well, then, what's the point of going
if we're not going to impress people?

412
00:26:56,525 --> 00:27:00,474
Well-- Uh.

413
00:27:08,245 --> 00:27:10,700
Romy, I still really,
really, really want to go.

414
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:16,501
- I know. Me too.
- Well then, can't we just,
like, think of something?

415
00:27:16,628 --> 00:27:22,298
- Okay. Well, the reunion is still
like two weeks away, right?
- Right.

416
00:27:22,426 --> 00:27:26,838
And all we really need is maybe some,
like, better jobs and boyfriends. Right?

417
00:27:26,972 --> 00:27:29,379
Yeah!

418
00:27:29,516 --> 00:27:34,012
But, okay. If those things were so easy
to get, wouldn't we already have them?

419
00:27:34,146 --> 00:27:36,055
Well, I mean, we never
really tried before.

420
00:27:36,189 --> 00:27:39,890
I mean, we never really had
a good enough reason, like going
to a reunion, to motivate us.

421
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:41,936
That's true.

422
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:46,613
Okay. So we're just going to have to make
ourselves more impressive, that's all.

423
00:27:46,742 --> 00:27:50,573
So I'm going to go out and bag us
some boyfriends, while you can
look for a cool new job.

424
00:27:50,704 --> 00:27:53,111
- Okay.
- Plus, I hate to say it...

425
00:27:53,248 --> 00:27:55,205
but I really think that
we should lose some weight.

426
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:57,207
Oh.

427
00:28:00,255 --> 00:28:02,960
Oh. Unh.

428
00:28:03,091 --> 00:28:06,674
Okay. I don't think that, like,
one chip makes a difference.

429
00:28:06,803 --> 00:28:08,962
It wasn't even
a whole chip.

430
00:28:17,606 --> 00:28:22,683
All right. According to this chart,
if we want to lose a pound a day...

431
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:25,275
we have to burn twice
as many calories as we eat.

432
00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:29,569
So, that means, if we want
to burn 4,000 calories...

433
00:28:30,994 --> 00:28:33,034
we only have to run
20 miles a day!

434
00:28:33,163 --> 00:28:36,497
Oh! Hey, Romy, remember
Mrs Chivas' class?

435
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:38,664
There was, like,
always a word problem.

436
00:28:38,794 --> 00:28:41,035
Like, there's a guy in
a rowboat going "X" miles...

437
00:28:41,171 --> 00:28:44,622
and the current is going, like,
you know, some... other miles...

438
00:28:44,758 --> 00:28:47,463
and, how long does it take him
to get to town?

439
00:28:47,594 --> 00:28:52,256
It was like, who cares? Who wants to go
to town with a guy who drives a rowboat?

440
00:28:52,391 --> 00:28:55,060
Okay, guys, let's jump.

441
00:28:58,647 --> 00:29:02,431
- Hey, Michele?
- Yeah?
- What does this remind you of?

442
00:29:02,567 --> 00:29:05,272
Well, I know.
This lady is totally sick.

443
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:14,659
Uh, let me just
say that, um...

444
00:29:14,788 --> 00:29:18,204
I am, like, really familiar
with the entire Versace line,
and if you would just...

445
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:23,754
give me a chance, I know I could,
like, sell the shit out of the stuff.

446
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,258
And, uh, to me,
fashion is just, it's like...

447
00:29:28,385 --> 00:29:31,090
everything. It's--

448
00:29:31,221 --> 00:29:34,637
By the way, that blouse-- Hi.
That blouse looks great on you.

449
00:29:34,766 --> 00:29:38,681
- Oh! Thank you!
- And see, I make a great salesperson...

450
00:29:38,812 --> 00:29:40,935
'cause I just have this,
like, really believable way...

451
00:29:41,064 --> 00:29:45,311
of telling people that they
look really good, even though
I'm just, like, you know--

452
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:53,693
I think
she heard me.

453
00:29:53,827 --> 00:29:56,947
Thank you so much
for coming.

454
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,493
- That's okay, you're welcome.
- I don't think we'll be
requiring any new staff.

455
00:30:01,626 --> 00:30:04,663
- You aren't taking on any what?
- Staff. Employees.

456
00:30:04,796 --> 00:30:07,003
Ohh! Oh, "staff."

457
00:30:07,132 --> 00:30:09,884
Okay, I didn't understand
with your big accent.

458
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:13,046
I couldn't
figure it out. Okay.

459
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:19,258
Fine. You know, you really shouldn't
let people fill out applications...

460
00:30:19,394 --> 00:30:23,890
if you don't want them to
actually try to get a job here.

461
00:30:24,024 --> 00:30:28,982
- It's a compli--
- No, no. That's all I have to say.
- Goodbye.

462
00:30:29,112 --> 00:30:32,113
If there ain't no love
then there ain't no use

463
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,740
Ooh, better walk on by
Better walk on through

464
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:40,780
Hi. Hey, um, great suit.
Is that an Armani?

465
00:30:40,916 --> 00:30:45,542
- Yes. Yes, it is.
- I thought so. So, what do you do?

466
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,755
- I'm a suit salesman.
- Oh, uh-oh

467
00:30:48,882 --> 00:30:53,710
Would you excuse me?
I cut my foot before,
and my shoe is filling up with blood.

468
00:30:55,222 --> 00:30:58,306
Ooh, if there ain't no love
then there ain't no use

469
00:30:58,433 --> 00:31:02,134
Ooh, better walk on by
Better walk on through

470
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:05,936
Hey, hey, there's a woman in the world
that you can't use

471
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:13,482
Ain't no love, Ain't no use
Ain't no love

472
00:31:13,615 --> 00:31:19,202
Yeah, well, my first choice was
to work at a boutique on Rodeo Drive,
but this would be okay.

473
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:23,576
Well, thank you. Unfortunately, we
don't have any openings here right now.

474
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:25,582
- Are you serious?
- Mm.

475
00:31:25,711 --> 00:31:30,123
Although we might have
an opening at our discount outlet.

476
00:31:30,257 --> 00:31:33,377
Okay, well, what street
would that be on?

477
00:31:54,781 --> 00:32:00,487
Come on, Michele. At this point,
any job is better than no job at all.

478
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:03,325
A discount outlet? Me?

479
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,492
Fine.

480
00:32:07,627 --> 00:32:10,201
So, any boyfriends yet?

481
00:32:10,338 --> 00:32:15,795
No. All the guys with good jobs
must be going to some other club.

482
00:32:15,927 --> 00:32:19,795
Oh, you know where Dana met her new
boyfriend? He's a William Morris agent.

483
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:23,715
Oh! Showbiz!
Good job! Where?

484
00:32:25,312 --> 00:32:28,681
Hi. My name is Romy,
and I'm an alcoholic.

485
00:32:28,815 --> 00:32:32,765
- Hi, Romy!
- Hey.

486
00:32:32,903 --> 00:32:36,485
And you also get a five-percent
employee discount...

487
00:32:36,615 --> 00:32:39,188
over and above our
everyday low prices.

488
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:43,074
You could make curtains
for the motorhome with this.

489
00:32:43,205 --> 00:32:47,416
- I got this tie for a dollar.
- You paid a whole dollar for that?

490
00:32:47,542 --> 00:32:50,330
- You betcha.
- Ah!

491
00:32:55,801 --> 00:32:58,374
She's one
of our regulars.

492
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:04,433
So, what do you think?

493
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,394
I-I'd like to go away.

494
00:33:19,825 --> 00:33:22,150
I know I'm supposed to wait
in that line, but listen.

495
00:33:22,285 --> 00:33:26,235
I wouldn't even be here if this
weren't, like, a dating emergency.

496
00:33:26,373 --> 00:33:30,702
Our cutoff is 25.
Try VH-1.

497
00:33:50,355 --> 00:33:55,266
The reunion's less than a week
away. I mean, I just can't
believe you turned down a job.

498
00:33:55,402 --> 00:33:57,940
Well, I thought the idea
was to impress people.

499
00:33:58,071 --> 00:34:02,733
I mean, how am I going
to impress anyone by selling
Ban-Lon smocks at Bargain Mart?

500
00:34:06,705 --> 00:34:09,457
I'm sick of this.
I'm going to go weigh myself.

501
00:34:21,261 --> 00:34:27,050
Oh, God! I've been killing myself
for eight days and I gained a pound.

502
00:34:27,184 --> 00:34:31,680
That's impossible! Did you
deduct 16 pounds for your shoes?

503
00:34:31,813 --> 00:34:35,063
Just forget it.
I'm not going.

504
00:34:35,192 --> 00:34:39,059
- What?
- Come on. Get real, Michele.
We're idiots.

505
00:34:39,196 --> 00:34:44,356
We can't get jobs and boyfriends,
and lose weight, in two weeks.

506
00:34:44,493 --> 00:34:47,066
But I thought
you said we could.

507
00:35:12,771 --> 00:35:17,100
Wow. God, the top female
executives are all so pretty.

508
00:35:19,319 --> 00:35:23,020
Those aren't the actual executives,
Michele. Those are models.

509
00:35:23,156 --> 00:35:25,826
Oh, I thought
they looked familiar.

510
00:35:25,951 --> 00:35:29,236
God, they really look like
executives, don't they?

511
00:35:29,371 --> 00:35:31,410
That's only because they're
wearing those stupid suits...

512
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,457
and phoney glasses,
and carrying briefcases.

513
00:35:34,584 --> 00:35:40,041
- Huh!
- Oh, my God, Michele, that's it!

514
00:35:40,173 --> 00:35:43,210
We can go to the reunion, and
just pretend to be successful!

515
00:35:43,343 --> 00:35:45,585
I mean, who's going to know?
They're in Tucson, we're here.

516
00:35:45,721 --> 00:35:48,176
We could just show up
looking like businesswomen.

517
00:35:48,306 --> 00:35:51,557
Oh, my God!
Oh!

518
00:35:51,685 --> 00:35:55,729
Wait. Ohh. But if the people at the
reunion see us drive up in a Nova...

519
00:35:55,856 --> 00:35:58,643
won't they know we're not
really businesswomen?

520
00:35:58,775 --> 00:36:01,397
If you can make us
the clothes...

521
00:36:01,528 --> 00:36:04,482
I can get us the car.

522
00:36:17,377 --> 00:36:21,505
Clear out, boys.
I need to talk to Ramon.

523
00:36:21,631 --> 00:36:23,505
Go!

524
00:36:27,763 --> 00:36:30,598
Yes, cara mia?

525
00:36:30,724 --> 00:36:34,175
Michele and I have this
high school reunion to go to...

526
00:36:34,311 --> 00:36:37,062
and we need to show up
in a really cool car.

527
00:36:37,189 --> 00:36:40,225
- Yeah?
- Todd told me that he gave
you a really great deal...

528
00:36:40,358 --> 00:36:45,945
- on an XJS convertible and
that you're fixing it up.
- Yeah?

529
00:36:46,073 --> 00:36:49,655
So...

530
00:36:49,785 --> 00:36:52,454
can I borrow your car?

531
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:55,248
Well, if I loan
you my car...

532
00:36:55,374 --> 00:36:58,125
what do I get?

533
00:36:58,251 --> 00:37:02,119
- Uh, what do you want?
- Ohh, Romy...

534
00:37:02,255 --> 00:37:04,295
you know what I want.

535
00:37:04,424 --> 00:37:08,469
Oh, forget it. I'm not going
to have sex with you
just to borrow your stupid car!

536
00:37:08,595 --> 00:37:10,753
I got to get something.

537
00:37:13,517 --> 00:37:15,640
Okay.

538
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:21,273
Close the blinds,
and we'll work something out.

539
00:37:23,235 --> 00:37:26,983
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh, Ramon!

540
00:37:27,114 --> 00:37:30,233
- Ohh, Ramon, ohh! Ohh!
- Check this out.

541
00:37:30,367 --> 00:37:33,237
- Oh, yes. Ohh.
- Oh, yeah.

542
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:35,659
- Oh, man!
- Ohh! Ohh!

543
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:38,576
Ohh, Ramon!
Ohh, Ramon!

544
00:37:38,709 --> 00:37:41,496
Ohh! Oh, yes.

545
00:37:43,797 --> 00:37:45,836
You are Columbus,
and I am America.

546
00:37:45,966 --> 00:37:49,501
Discover me, Ramon!
Just discover me.

547
00:37:49,636 --> 00:37:53,301
Hey, uh-- Explosions.
The earth is moving.

548
00:37:53,432 --> 00:37:58,094
Explosions!
The earth is moving!

549
00:37:58,228 --> 00:38:02,641
Ah, ooh-- is that an earthquake?
No, it's Ramon.

550
00:38:02,774 --> 00:38:07,851
Is that an earthquake?
No, it's Ramon!

551
00:38:07,988 --> 00:38:10,230
Ahh! It's Ramon!

552
00:38:10,365 --> 00:38:14,529
Man stallion, fill me
with your giant love wand!

553
00:38:14,661 --> 00:38:16,737
What? No, I'm sorry.
I don't think so.

554
00:38:16,872 --> 00:38:20,241
Well, say something nice
about my penis!

555
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:23,744
Oh, Ramon, your penis
is so powerful. I'm coming!

556
00:38:23,879 --> 00:38:27,711
- Okay, thanks. Get off me now.
- Aw, come on, wh--

557
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:30,379
- You wanted it to be believable.
- Aww.

558
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:34,460
I'm just a girl
in the world

559
00:38:34,598 --> 00:38:39,224
That's all that
you'll let me be

560
00:38:39,352 --> 00:38:43,979
Oh, I'm just a girl
living in captivity

561
00:38:47,235 --> 00:38:49,442
Oh, my God!
You did it!

562
00:38:49,571 --> 00:38:54,363
Yeah, I did.
All right, let's get going.

563
00:38:54,493 --> 00:38:57,992
Oh, this is going to
be so much fun.

564
00:38:58,121 --> 00:39:00,446
- So, what'd you have to do to get it?
- I had to give all the guys...

565
00:39:00,582 --> 00:39:03,583
in the service department
hand jobs.

566
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,747
Well, while you were doing that,
I taped all the nostalgic songs...

567
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,331
from high school,
to get us in the mood.

568
00:39:10,467 --> 00:39:13,254
- Michele?
- Huh?
- I was kidding.

569
00:39:13,387 --> 00:39:17,598
- What?
- You actually think I would
do something like that?

570
00:39:17,724 --> 00:39:21,259
For a car?

571
00:39:21,395 --> 00:39:24,146
- Okay, just get in.
- Okay.

572
00:39:29,736 --> 00:39:32,773
Hey, look what else
I got us, little lady.

573
00:39:32,906 --> 00:39:35,611
- Oh, my God. It's a flip phone!
- Uh-huh.

574
00:39:35,742 --> 00:39:37,782
- How'd you get this?
- I bought it.

575
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:44,664
Okay.

576
00:39:51,049 --> 00:39:52,923
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

577
00:39:53,051 --> 00:39:55,589
Let's do it.

578
00:39:55,721 --> 00:39:57,594
Tonight
I got to cut loose

579
00:39:57,723 --> 00:39:59,596
- Footloose
- Footloose!
- Footloose!

580
00:39:59,725 --> 00:40:02,180
- Kick off my Sunday shoes
- Kick off my Sunday knees?

581
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:06,094
- Oowhee, Louise
- I have no idea what
the rest of the lyrics are.

582
00:40:06,231 --> 00:40:09,185
- Me neither. Whoo!
- Jack, get back

583
00:40:09,317 --> 00:40:12,354
- Watch out, Tucson, here we come!
- Come on before we crack

584
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:16,611
- Shit!
- Aww.

585
00:40:22,539 --> 00:40:27,166
- Loose your blues
- Watch out, Tucson, here we come!
- Everybody cut footloose

586
00:40:27,294 --> 00:40:30,994
Footloose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes

587
00:40:31,131 --> 00:40:33,088
- Shit!
- Aww.

588
00:40:35,802 --> 00:40:39,005
- Footloose
- Whoo!

589
00:40:42,017 --> 00:40:44,769
- You're playing so cool
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

590
00:40:44,895 --> 00:40:47,350
Obeying every rule

591
00:40:47,481 --> 00:40:50,102
- Dig way down in your heart
- Down in your art--

592
00:40:50,233 --> 00:40:52,522
- You're yearning, burning
- You're flurning, burning, earning

593
00:40:52,652 --> 00:40:55,689
- Somebody to tell you
- Somebody better tell you

594
00:40:55,822 --> 00:40:59,191
- That life ain't passing you by
- You have one hell of an eye

595
00:41:00,827 --> 00:41:03,579
- Everybody cut, everybody cut
- Everybody cut, everybody cut

596
00:41:03,705 --> 00:41:06,279
- Everybody cut, everybody cut
- Everybody cut, everybody cut

597
00:41:06,416 --> 00:41:08,456
- Everybody cut, everybody cut
- Everybody cut, everybody cut

598
00:41:08,585 --> 00:41:11,041
- Everybody, everybody cut footloose
- Footloose

599
00:41:24,684 --> 00:41:27,176
I got your picture
I got your picture

600
00:41:27,312 --> 00:41:29,768
I'd like a million of you
all to myself

601
00:41:29,898 --> 00:41:32,436
I want a doctor
to take a picture

602
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:35,105
So I can look at you
from inside as well

603
00:41:35,237 --> 00:41:39,104
- You got me turning up and turning down
- Okay, I give up. What are you doing?

604
00:41:39,241 --> 00:41:41,566
Pass this car.
This kid is so obnoxious.

605
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:46,325
- Turning Japanese
- Oh, my God. What is with that kid?

606
00:41:46,456 --> 00:41:48,912
I don't know.
He is sick!

607
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:54,463
Turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so

608
00:41:54,589 --> 00:41:59,417
Turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so

609
00:41:59,553 --> 00:42:02,257
Turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I really think so

610
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:04,880
Oh, I'm sorry. No.

611
00:42:05,016 --> 00:42:08,101
No, not you. No. I was trying
to scare your little boy.

612
00:42:10,897 --> 00:42:14,349
Oh, my God.
Are my lips that big?

613
00:42:18,113 --> 00:42:20,983
Woke up this morning
happy as can be

614
00:42:21,116 --> 00:42:23,322
- Some more of that?
- Yeah.

615
00:42:23,452 --> 00:42:25,943
All right. Now, just remember,
from this point on...

616
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,863
we are sophisticated, educated,
successful career women.

617
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,784
Right. Okay.

618
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,704
God, this underwear is totally
riding up my butt crack.

619
00:42:40,427 --> 00:42:44,175
Yeah. Hello.
Um, we need something to go.

620
00:42:44,306 --> 00:42:49,217
- Okay.
- Do you have some sort of
businesswoman's special?

621
00:42:50,854 --> 00:42:53,012
- Come again?
- Well, we're businesswomen.

622
00:42:53,148 --> 00:42:57,774
- Yeah. From L.A.
- And you know some places have,
like, a lunch special.

623
00:42:57,903 --> 00:43:00,738
For businesswomen.

624
00:43:00,864 --> 00:43:04,114
We don't have
anything like that.

625
00:43:04,242 --> 00:43:07,861
Well, then why don't you
just give us, um, two burgers
and fries and Diet Cokes...

626
00:43:07,996 --> 00:43:11,412
- 'cause we're in a hurry.
- Mm. We're due in Tucson later.

627
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:15,491
For a business thing.
You know.

628
00:43:15,629 --> 00:43:17,621
What kind
of business you in?

629
00:43:27,974 --> 00:43:30,975
I can't believe we never thought
of what to say we did for a living.

630
00:43:31,103 --> 00:43:33,772
Oh. Which one
of these guys...

631
00:43:33,897 --> 00:43:36,649
will I have sex with
at the reunion?

632
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:40,066
Ooh!
Casey Degan!

633
00:43:40,195 --> 00:43:43,279
- Aaah!
- Come on! Now, we're
running out of time.

634
00:43:45,992 --> 00:43:49,860
I know. Why don't we say
that we own our own company?

635
00:43:49,996 --> 00:43:52,404
Ooh, good.
Like what?

636
00:43:52,541 --> 00:43:56,289
- Like, what if we invented something?
- Like what?

637
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:00,749
Well, okay, l-l think it should
be like something that-that
everybody has heard about...

638
00:44:00,882 --> 00:44:03,967
but-but nobody really
knows who invented it.

639
00:44:04,094 --> 00:44:06,252
Oh, my God! I've got it!
Post-lts!

640
00:44:06,388 --> 00:44:09,638
- Everybody knows what Post-lts are!
- Yeah!

641
00:44:09,766 --> 00:44:12,969
They're the little yellow things
with the stickum on the back, right?

642
00:44:13,103 --> 00:44:15,096
Okay.

643
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:18,101
Okay, we're-we're working in this
advertising agency after college.

644
00:44:18,233 --> 00:44:20,309
- Ooh, college! Good one!
- Yeah.

645
00:44:20,444 --> 00:44:23,647
And we have, like, this big,
like, presentation...

646
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,654
to make to,
like, a client.

647
00:44:25,782 --> 00:44:28,569
- Hmm!
- So-so-so we're, like, brainstorming...

648
00:44:28,702 --> 00:44:31,323
and all of the sudden
we're out of paper clips!

649
00:44:31,455 --> 00:44:34,824
- Good!
- And so, okay-- So then l, l, like--

650
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:37,164
Okay, I say--
I say-- Okay--

651
00:44:37,294 --> 00:44:40,579
"Wouldn't it be great if there
was, like, this, like, stickum
on the back of this paper...

652
00:44:40,714 --> 00:44:44,712
"so, like, it-it would just--
if I laid it on top of that
other paper it would just stay...

653
00:44:44,843 --> 00:44:46,717
you know, like,
without a paper clip?"

654
00:44:46,845 --> 00:44:48,470
- Yes!
- Ahh!

655
00:44:48,597 --> 00:44:50,803
So then you've got, like, this
grandfather or this uncle...

656
00:44:50,932 --> 00:44:53,554
that, like, has, like, a-- like a--
like a paper company or a paper mill...

657
00:44:53,685 --> 00:44:56,686
and-and he's, like, really into it,
and the rest is history!

658
00:44:56,813 --> 00:44:59,185
Oh, my God!
It is perfect!

659
00:44:59,316 --> 00:45:02,400
Wow!
Don't you think?

660
00:45:02,527 --> 00:45:05,362
Well, yeah, but--

661
00:45:05,489 --> 00:45:08,490
- "Well, yeah, but" what?
- I don't know.

662
00:45:08,617 --> 00:45:11,737
I mean, it just sounds like you invented
Post-lts all by yourself, you know.

663
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:15,369
-I mean, what did I do?
-Well, it was your grandfather or uncle.

664
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:18,375
Yeah?

665
00:45:18,502 --> 00:45:21,372
Okay, you know,
so we could say that...

666
00:45:21,505 --> 00:45:23,378
you were,
like, the designer.

667
00:45:23,507 --> 00:45:26,710
Like, I thought of them, but you
thought of making them yellow.

668
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,390
Well, no, but it's like
most of these people...

669
00:45:31,515 --> 00:45:33,887
have, like, known us
since elementary school.

670
00:45:34,017 --> 00:45:36,888
I just think that you're
more believable as a designer...

671
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:40,685
rather than
as an inventor, you know?

672
00:45:40,816 --> 00:45:43,567
- Uh-huh.
- You're my lover

673
00:45:43,693 --> 00:45:47,027
Not my rival

674
00:45:47,155 --> 00:45:49,029
- What are you doing?
- Look.

675
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,027
You're obviously
pissed at me.

676
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,034
No. Uh-uh. Why should
I be pissed at you?

677
00:45:54,162 --> 00:45:56,238
Just because now I know
how you really feel about me.

678
00:45:56,373 --> 00:45:58,200
Oh, my God,
I knew this would happen.

679
00:45:58,333 --> 00:46:01,536
I mean, I try, for once,
to be honest with you...

680
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:03,544
and it blows up
in my face.

681
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:11,674
God!
You want to be honest?

682
00:46:11,805 --> 00:46:14,676
Okay, good!
Let's be honest!

683
00:46:16,059 --> 00:46:17,933
I let you
have the ideas!

684
00:46:18,061 --> 00:46:20,101
- What?
- Yeah, I let you have the ideas...

685
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:22,721
so you won't feel so bad
that I'm cuter.

686
00:46:22,858 --> 00:46:26,606
- You are not cuter, Michele.
- I am so cuter.

687
00:46:26,737 --> 00:46:29,228
It's, like, common knowledge, Romy.
Everybody thinks so.

688
00:46:29,364 --> 00:46:31,902
I'm the Mary
and you're the Rhoda.

689
00:46:32,034 --> 00:46:34,489
That's ridiculous. You're the Rhoda.
You're the Jewish one.

690
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:37,490
Oh, my God. I'm talking
cuteness-wise, Romy, okay?

691
00:46:37,622 --> 00:46:39,781
And cuteness-wise,
I'm the Mary.

692
00:46:39,916 --> 00:46:44,294
That's crazy! You have absolutely
no proof that you're cuter!

693
00:46:44,421 --> 00:46:46,912
Oh, proof? You want proof?
Okay, fine.

694
00:46:47,049 --> 00:46:49,586
- Who lost their virginity first?
- Oh, big wow!

695
00:46:49,718 --> 00:46:52,802
With your cousin Barry.
I wouldn't brag about it.

696
00:46:52,929 --> 00:46:57,472
Okay, so who always gets asked to
dance first when we go to clubs, huh?

697
00:46:57,601 --> 00:47:00,008
No wonder you couldn't
find us boyfriends, Romy.

698
00:47:04,983 --> 00:47:07,557
Well, so what?
You can't even get a job!

699
00:47:07,694 --> 00:47:11,644
- I carry you, Michele!
Without me, you'd be lost!
- That is such a lie!

700
00:47:11,782 --> 00:47:14,652
Oh, yeah? Well, let's just see.
Let's split up and see what happens.

701
00:47:14,785 --> 00:47:16,861
W-What do you mean,
split up?

702
00:47:16,995 --> 00:47:20,827
When we get to Tucson,
we're going our own separate ways.

703
00:47:20,957 --> 00:47:22,867
Okay. Good.

704
00:47:23,001 --> 00:47:24,875
Fine.
I don't care.

705
00:47:25,003 --> 00:47:26,711
- Fine!
- Fine.

706
00:47:26,838 --> 00:47:28,997
As of Tucson,
we're finished.

707
00:47:30,092 --> 00:47:32,298
Well, drive fast!

708
00:48:24,604 --> 00:48:28,685
Always something there
to remind me

709
00:48:41,955 --> 00:48:44,826
Wow.
Billy Christianson?

710
00:48:47,002 --> 00:48:49,327
Romy. Romy White.

711
00:48:49,463 --> 00:48:52,914
No. No way.

712
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:55,291
My God, you--
you look fantastic.

713
00:48:55,427 --> 00:48:59,259
I mean, l-- I never would have
recognized you in a million years.

714
00:48:59,389 --> 00:49:01,714
Thanks.

715
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:05,468
So, what have you been doing
since high school?

716
00:49:05,604 --> 00:49:08,973
Well,
believe it or not...

717
00:49:09,107 --> 00:49:11,314
I invented Post-lts.

718
00:49:22,496 --> 00:49:24,038
So I told Prescott...

719
00:49:24,164 --> 00:49:27,615
"You can either pay me the 150
or I am out of here. Bye-bye."

720
00:49:27,751 --> 00:49:31,962
I mean, there are at least 12
other major markets that would
put me on the air tomorrow.

721
00:49:32,089 --> 00:49:35,089
Wow. So you did it?
You're an anchorwoman?

722
00:49:35,217 --> 00:49:38,965
No.
I'm a weather girl.

723
00:49:39,096 --> 00:49:41,503
On the highest-rated
5:00 news in Tucson.

724
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,467
- Oh.
- So...

725
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,301
Michele,
what are you up to?

726
00:49:47,437 --> 00:49:50,972
Uh, okay.
Um, I invented Post-lts.

727
00:49:51,108 --> 00:49:53,812
- You're kidding!
- You must've made a fortune!

728
00:49:53,944 --> 00:49:55,983
Well, yeah.

729
00:49:56,113 --> 00:49:57,986
No offence, Michele...

730
00:49:58,115 --> 00:50:01,199
but how in the world
did you think of Post-lts?

731
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,286
Um... well...

732
00:50:06,415 --> 00:50:08,288
uh...

733
00:50:10,419 --> 00:50:13,040
And I invented them
totally by myself.

734
00:50:13,171 --> 00:50:17,121
I mean, all Michele did was say,
"What about making them yellow?"

735
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:20,133
Really?

736
00:50:26,768 --> 00:50:31,679
- Actually, I invented
a special kind of glue.
- Oh, really?

737
00:50:31,815 --> 00:50:34,520
Well, then I'm sure you wouldn't
mind giving us a detailed account...

738
00:50:34,651 --> 00:50:38,863
of exactly how you concocted
this miracle glue, would you?

739
00:50:39,781 --> 00:50:43,031
No. Um--

740
00:50:44,202 --> 00:50:47,037
Well, ordinarily
when you make glue...

741
00:50:47,164 --> 00:50:50,497
first you need to
thermoset your resin...

742
00:50:50,625 --> 00:50:54,872
and then after it cools
you mix in a, um, epoxide.

743
00:50:55,005 --> 00:50:57,294
Which is really just
a fancy-schmancy name...

744
00:50:57,424 --> 00:51:00,709
for any simple,
oxygenated adhesive, right?

745
00:51:00,844 --> 00:51:04,924
But then I thought maybe-- just maybe--
you could raise the viscosity...

746
00:51:05,057 --> 00:51:09,101
by adding a complex glucose derivative
during the emulsification process.

747
00:51:09,227 --> 00:51:12,228
And it turns out,
I was right.

748
00:51:14,024 --> 00:51:16,396
Huh?
I don't believe it.

749
00:51:16,526 --> 00:51:20,026
You must be the most successful
person in our graduating class.

750
00:51:20,155 --> 00:51:23,072
Uh-huh.
And you're not. Bye.

751
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,569
Always something there
to remind me

752
00:51:36,213 --> 00:51:38,086
This is so great.

753
00:51:40,884 --> 00:51:42,758
Romy?

754
00:51:44,721 --> 00:51:46,595
Can I ask you
something?

755
00:51:49,518 --> 00:51:52,388
Romy! You will not believe
what just happened!

756
00:51:52,521 --> 00:51:54,928
Michele, can't you see
that I am busy?

757
00:51:56,274 --> 00:51:58,481
Fine.
Okay, just forget it.

758
00:52:04,282 --> 00:52:06,987
Whoa! Oh. Oww.

759
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,491
Oww. Oww. Oww.

760
00:52:09,621 --> 00:52:11,080
Oh!

761
00:52:11,206 --> 00:52:13,779
Oh! Come on!

762
00:52:15,085 --> 00:52:17,837
Oh, God!
Are you all right?

763
00:52:17,963 --> 00:52:20,584
- What do you think?
- I am so sorry.

764
00:52:20,716 --> 00:52:23,586
My-My-My driver
didn't see you.

765
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:26,838
Please. Come.

766
00:52:26,972 --> 00:52:30,672
I have boxes of Kleenex
in my limo.

767
00:52:30,809 --> 00:52:32,683
Let me make it up
to you.

768
00:52:35,772 --> 00:52:37,148
Okay.

769
00:52:47,242 --> 00:52:50,029
Oh, my God.

770
00:52:50,162 --> 00:52:53,661
- Here. Help yourself, Michele.
- Thanks.

771
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:55,997
Wait. How do you
know my name?

772
00:52:56,126 --> 00:52:59,329
It's me, Michele.
Sandy.

773
00:52:59,463 --> 00:53:02,298
- Sandy Frink?
- Uh-huh.

774
00:53:02,424 --> 00:53:04,832
But you're so dreamy.

775
00:53:04,968 --> 00:53:06,842
Well, when I made
my first million...

776
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:10,054
my present to myself
was a new face.

777
00:53:10,182 --> 00:53:12,055
Okay, I'm not
just saying this...

778
00:53:12,184 --> 00:53:14,390
but you really picked
a good one.

779
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:16,512
Thanks.

780
00:53:18,065 --> 00:53:20,187
I had this notebook...

781
00:53:20,317 --> 00:53:24,480
with "Mrs Romy Christianson" written
on it, like, about a thousand times.

782
00:53:26,615 --> 00:53:29,485
Now you think
I'm some sort of geek.

783
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:33,575
No. No.

784
00:53:33,705 --> 00:53:36,825
No, not at all.

785
00:53:38,335 --> 00:53:40,541
I'm flattered.

786
00:53:43,507 --> 00:53:45,879
Hi, Billy.

787
00:53:46,009 --> 00:53:48,500
I've been looking
all over for you.

788
00:53:49,346 --> 00:53:51,220
You want to dance once?

789
00:53:51,348 --> 00:53:54,218
You know,
for old times' sake.

790
00:54:01,691 --> 00:54:04,017
No, thanks.

791
00:54:06,029 --> 00:54:08,567
I owe this one to Romy.

792
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:38,678
Hey, you guys, they're about
to announce the winners of the vote.

793
00:54:38,812 --> 00:54:41,896
- Come on!
- Vote? What vote?

794
00:54:42,023 --> 00:54:45,855
- Let's go. We got to get in there.
- Okay.

795
00:54:49,656 --> 00:54:52,112
Wait, I can't
find my top.

796
00:54:53,326 --> 00:54:55,734
Where are you?

797
00:55:07,799 --> 00:55:09,756
Hey, how you guys
doing tonight?

798
00:55:09,885 --> 00:55:14,132
I bet, uh, everyone
is as anxious...

799
00:55:14,264 --> 00:55:16,755
as I am to hear
the results of the vote.

800
00:55:16,892 --> 00:55:18,683
What vote?

801
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:23,603
The person voted Most Changed
for the Better Since High School is--

802
00:55:25,233 --> 00:55:29,101
It's a tie.
It's a tie.

803
00:55:29,237 --> 00:55:32,487
The Most Changed for the Better
Since High School are...

804
00:55:32,616 --> 00:55:36,779
Romy White
and Michele Weinberger.

805
00:55:42,125 --> 00:55:46,503
Honey, go on up there
and get your medal.

806
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:48,504
Okay.

807
00:55:48,632 --> 00:55:52,001
How weird. I didn't
even know we were voting.

808
00:56:13,615 --> 00:56:15,738
Get me another daiquiri.

809
00:56:24,501 --> 00:56:26,375
Here you go.

810
00:56:28,004 --> 00:56:32,168
Um, I'm sorry.
I couldn't find my top.

811
00:56:37,973 --> 00:56:39,882
Honey,
that is beautiful.

812
00:58:08,146 --> 00:58:10,186
May I take that
for you, sir?

813
00:58:10,315 --> 00:58:14,147
No, no, no.
You leave me alone.

814
00:58:19,282 --> 00:58:24,158
Looking at your medal
from the reunion again, dear?

815
00:58:26,498 --> 00:58:29,285
You miss her,
don't you?

816
00:58:30,419 --> 00:58:32,292
Duh.

817
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:35,003
Michele...

818
00:58:37,676 --> 00:58:42,753
have you been terribly unhappy
with me all these years?

819
00:58:42,889 --> 00:58:45,178
Oh, no.
No, Sandy.

820
00:58:45,308 --> 00:58:47,135
Oh, good.

821
00:58:47,269 --> 00:58:50,851
I've just been lonely
with no one to talk to.

822
00:58:53,692 --> 00:58:55,981
Why don't you call her?

823
00:58:57,362 --> 00:58:59,236
- Okay.
- Yeah.

824
00:59:05,871 --> 00:59:09,037
- Hello?
- Billy Christianson?

825
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:12,416
Oh, no, no,
I'm-I'm Billy Junior.

826
00:59:12,544 --> 00:59:16,873
Oh, Billy, honey,
is your mommy home?

827
00:59:17,007 --> 00:59:18,798
Well, yeah.

828
00:59:18,925 --> 00:59:22,508
Yeah, but, uh, she can't come
to the phone right now.

829
00:59:22,637 --> 00:59:24,511
She-She's on
her deathbed.

830
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:26,881
- Romy.
- Oh, dear.

831
00:59:27,017 --> 00:59:29,056
Billy, honey...

832
00:59:29,186 --> 00:59:34,061
tell your mommy that
Michele Weinberger-Frink...

833
00:59:34,191 --> 00:59:36,064
is on the phone...

834
00:59:36,193 --> 00:59:40,321
and would very much
like to speak with her.

835
00:59:46,703 --> 00:59:49,075
No.

836
00:59:49,206 --> 00:59:51,198
Not until you admit...

837
00:59:51,333 --> 00:59:54,749
that I'm the Mary,
and you're the Rhoda.

838
00:59:55,754 --> 00:59:58,423
I'm the Mary.

839
00:59:58,548 --> 01:00:00,422
I'm the Mary!

840
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:05,711
I'm the-- You're a pasty hag
on a deathbed.

841
01:00:06,848 --> 01:00:10,928
I'm the Mary.
Everybody knows.

842
01:00:11,061 --> 01:00:13,386
Way to go, honey.

843
01:00:25,325 --> 01:00:27,781
Oh, God.

844
01:00:27,911 --> 01:00:29,785
Oh, we're really here.

845
01:00:32,249 --> 01:00:34,407
- Oh, God.
- Good evening, sir.

846
01:00:34,543 --> 01:00:36,619
Thanks for not
waking me up, Romy.

847
01:00:36,753 --> 01:00:39,125
God, what a bitch.

848
01:00:59,067 --> 01:01:01,938
Don't get me wrong

849
01:01:04,072 --> 01:01:06,444
If I'm looking
kind of dazzled

850
01:01:09,077 --> 01:01:12,446
I see neon lights

851
01:01:13,582 --> 01:01:16,452
Whenever you walk by

852
01:01:18,086 --> 01:01:20,458
Don't get me wrong

853
01:01:21,798 --> 01:01:24,918
- Hey, Romy White.
- Hey.

854
01:01:25,052 --> 01:01:29,001
- Where's Michele?
- I don't know.

855
01:01:29,139 --> 01:01:31,464
Um, anybody see
Billy Christianson?

856
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,351
- Try the bar.
- Thanks, man.

857
01:01:37,022 --> 01:01:40,640
Don't get me wrong

858
01:01:40,776 --> 01:01:44,476
Oh, excuse me, excuse me.
You-you can't go in without a name tag.

859
01:01:44,613 --> 01:01:46,522
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

860
01:01:46,656 --> 01:01:48,614
Uh, Michele Weinberger.

861
01:01:48,742 --> 01:01:53,320
Oh, my God, Michele Weinberger!
My God, you look great!

862
01:01:53,455 --> 01:01:56,871
It's me, Toby.
Oh, Toby Walters.

863
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,372
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

864
01:01:59,503 --> 01:02:01,661
Um, oh, here it is.
Here is your name tag.

865
01:02:01,797 --> 01:02:04,038
And, um, Romy
is already inside.

866
01:02:04,174 --> 01:02:07,839
- I could care less.
I am not here with Romy.
- You're kidding me.

867
01:02:07,969 --> 01:02:10,211
No, we're not
even friends any more.

868
01:02:10,347 --> 01:02:13,383
We had this big falling out
over Post-lts.

869
01:02:14,601 --> 01:02:16,594
- Post-lts?
- It's a long story.

870
01:02:16,728 --> 01:02:18,602
- See you.
- W-W--

871
01:02:24,027 --> 01:02:26,898
I'm only off to wander

872
01:02:29,032 --> 01:02:31,903
Across a moonlit night

873
01:02:34,871 --> 01:02:37,362
Once in a while

874
01:02:37,499 --> 01:02:39,539
Two people meet

875
01:02:39,668 --> 01:02:43,712
Seemingly, for no reason
they just pass on the street

876
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:48,880
Suddenly thundershowers
everywhere

877
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:51,050
Who can explain
the thunder and rain

878
01:02:51,179 --> 01:02:53,255
But there's something
in the air

879
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:55,762
Ooh, excuse me.

880
01:02:55,892 --> 01:02:57,802
Hi, Romy.
How are you?

881
01:02:57,936 --> 01:03:01,103
- Lisa Luder?
- Yes.

882
01:03:02,524 --> 01:03:05,145
So, where's the rest
of the "A" group?

883
01:03:05,277 --> 01:03:07,649
Oh, they're around here
someplace.

884
01:03:07,779 --> 01:03:09,902
We sort of lost touch
over the years.

885
01:03:10,031 --> 01:03:14,076
Wow. Isn't it weird when you're
not friends with your friends any more?

886
01:03:14,202 --> 01:03:18,995
I mean, Michele and I just fell
out of touch about two hours ago.

887
01:03:19,124 --> 01:03:20,998
Because she's selfish...

888
01:03:21,126 --> 01:03:23,415
and she always,
like, devalues me.

889
01:03:23,545 --> 01:03:25,419
And I'm sick of it,
you know?

890
01:03:29,593 --> 01:03:32,131
God, you guys are easy
to talk to.

891
01:03:32,262 --> 01:03:34,136
I invented Post-lts.

892
01:03:36,641 --> 01:03:40,307
- You know, the yellow things
with the stickum on the back?
- Yes, I know what they are.

893
01:03:40,437 --> 01:03:43,189
So, uh,
what are you up to?

894
01:03:43,315 --> 01:03:47,359
I'm an associate fashion editor
for Vogue.

895
01:03:47,486 --> 01:03:50,771
Wow! Wh--
Good job!

896
01:03:50,906 --> 01:03:54,156
Boy, I must have, like,
every single issue of Vogue...

897
01:03:54,284 --> 01:03:57,404
for the past ten years.

898
01:03:57,537 --> 01:04:00,704
Okay, well, it was
very nice talking with you.

899
01:04:00,832 --> 01:04:02,991
Nice talking to you too.

900
01:04:04,628 --> 01:04:07,498
Okay, Romy.

901
01:04:07,631 --> 01:04:10,466
It might just be
fantastic

902
01:04:12,094 --> 01:04:14,501
Don't get me wrong

903
01:04:24,356 --> 01:04:26,230
It was so cute.

904
01:04:26,358 --> 01:04:28,730
My mom gave us
a new car seat for the baby.

905
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:31,861
And when the box arrived, little
Jake looks up at me and says...

906
01:04:31,988 --> 01:04:34,064
"Mommy,
is that the baby?"

907
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:37,319
- Oh.
- I wish.

908
01:04:38,245 --> 01:04:39,620
Hey, everyone.

909
01:04:39,746 --> 01:04:42,617
- And so we meet again.
- Oh, hi.

910
01:04:43,792 --> 01:04:44,990
Romy White.

911
01:04:46,503 --> 01:04:48,377
You're the chubby girl.

912
01:04:48,505 --> 01:04:53,001
Oh, well, I was, but I haven't
been for a really long time.

913
01:04:53,135 --> 01:04:55,673
So, what are
all of you up to?

914
01:04:55,804 --> 01:04:58,675
Christie, in the yearbook you said
that you wanted Jane Pauley's job.

915
01:04:58,807 --> 01:05:01,761
Are you a big TV news
anchorwoman now?

916
01:05:01,893 --> 01:05:05,393
Oh, no, I don't even
watch TV any more.

917
01:05:05,522 --> 01:05:09,223
My priorities have changed
since I became a mommy.

918
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:11,850
Can you believe
this is number three?

919
01:05:11,987 --> 01:05:14,359
Wow, three kids.

920
01:05:14,489 --> 01:05:16,612
God, you must feel
really tied down.

921
01:05:18,368 --> 01:05:21,737
Not at all.
I feel very fulfilled.

922
01:05:21,872 --> 01:05:25,739
Besides, Billy always
wanted a big family.

923
01:05:28,378 --> 01:05:31,249
- Billy Christianson?
- Mm-hmm.

924
01:05:31,381 --> 01:05:34,418
- You married Billy Christianson?
- Mm-hmm.

925
01:05:34,551 --> 01:05:37,172
For almost ten years now.

926
01:05:37,304 --> 01:05:40,055
Billy's in
real estate development.

927
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:44,931
So, how about you?
Any kids?

928
01:05:45,771 --> 01:05:47,644
Oh, uh, no.

929
01:05:47,773 --> 01:05:51,605
I just haven't had time, you know, what
with running my own business and all.

930
01:05:51,735 --> 01:05:53,609
Your own business?

931
01:05:53,737 --> 01:05:57,320
Yeah.
I invented Post-lts.

932
01:05:58,825 --> 01:06:00,782
No, really.
What do you do?

933
01:06:01,995 --> 01:06:06,491
That's what I do.
I invented Post-lts.

934
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:09,661
Oh. You're kidding me.

935
01:06:12,422 --> 01:06:14,581
Well, I've made
a lot of money.

936
01:06:14,716 --> 01:06:17,753
Oh, you know who they say
has made a ton of money? Sandy Frink.

937
01:06:17,886 --> 01:06:19,760
- The Frink-a-zoid?
- Yeah.

938
01:06:19,888 --> 01:06:23,589
He invented some special kind
of rubber that's used in every
tennis shoe in North America.

939
01:06:23,725 --> 01:06:26,299
Hey, if anybody
needs to make a call...

940
01:06:26,436 --> 01:06:28,974
I've got a phone.

941
01:06:46,456 --> 01:06:48,330
- Is Sandy Frink here?
- Uh, no.

942
01:06:48,458 --> 01:06:51,329
-Uh, you can't go in without a name tag.
-Fuck off!

943
01:06:51,461 --> 01:06:55,791
Heather Mooney? Oh, my God,
you're exactly the same.

944
01:06:55,924 --> 01:06:58,462
Oh, my God.
Heather Mooney is here?

945
01:07:01,346 --> 01:07:03,671
This ought to be so good.

946
01:07:07,018 --> 01:07:09,474
Oh, God, don't look now.
It's Heather Mooney.

947
01:07:09,604 --> 01:07:12,356
- What?
- Hello, Romy.

948
01:07:12,482 --> 01:07:14,973
Uh-- E-- Uh-- You--

949
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:18,693
Oh, uh-- Heather,
you said you weren't coming.

950
01:07:18,822 --> 01:07:22,357
Yeah, well, since Sandy
and Michele aren't married--

951
01:07:22,492 --> 01:07:24,864
What a waste
of a tank of gas, huh?

952
01:07:26,455 --> 01:07:28,447
Okay, well, come on.
I'll help you go find him.

953
01:07:28,582 --> 01:07:32,033
Uh, he's not here. I already asked Toby
Dumbfuck. Obviously, I've interrupted.

954
01:07:32,169 --> 01:07:35,086
Why don't you just go back to ignoring
me like you did in high school?

955
01:07:35,213 --> 01:07:37,087
No, you can stay.

956
01:07:37,215 --> 01:07:41,509
We're just discussing our class
success stories. So, what are you up to?

957
01:07:41,636 --> 01:07:44,590
Ever hear of Lady Fair cigarettes?
I invented the quick-burning paper.

958
01:07:44,723 --> 01:07:48,008
- Wow, we have a whole class
full of inventors.
- Meaning?

959
01:07:48,143 --> 01:07:50,017
Oh, you know, Sandy Frink
invented something too.

960
01:07:50,145 --> 01:07:53,016
- Hey, isn't that Sandy over there now?
- What did Sandy invent?

961
01:07:53,148 --> 01:07:57,691
- Some kind of rubber.
- Romy here invented Post-lts.
- You did not.

962
01:07:57,819 --> 01:07:58,851
- Yeah, I did.
- You did not.

963
01:07:58,987 --> 01:07:59,936
- Yeah, I did.
- You did not.

964
01:08:00,072 --> 01:08:01,352
Yeah, l--
Well, who did then?

965
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:03,696
A guy named Art Fry
from the 3M Corp.

966
01:08:03,825 --> 01:08:06,281
We studied it
in business school.

967
01:08:09,373 --> 01:08:10,748
You're kidding me.

968
01:08:10,874 --> 01:08:13,579
You just
made all that up?

969
01:08:27,057 --> 01:08:29,726
Oh, God,
you are so weird.

970
01:08:31,353 --> 01:08:33,476
- Why don't you just leave her alone?
- Michele.

971
01:08:33,605 --> 01:08:36,772
Oh, it's
the back brace girl.

972
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:39,605
- Hi, back brace girl.
- Hi, back brace girl.

973
01:08:39,736 --> 01:08:42,607
Oh, shut up.

974
01:08:42,739 --> 01:08:44,779
And what are you
picking on us for anyway?

975
01:08:44,908 --> 01:08:47,280
We are not the ones
who got fat.

976
01:08:47,411 --> 01:08:50,281
We're pregnant,
you half-wit.

977
01:08:50,414 --> 01:08:53,284
Oh, yeah, well...

978
01:08:53,417 --> 01:08:56,583
I hope your babies
look like monkeys.

979
01:08:56,712 --> 01:08:58,621
Come on, Romy.

980
01:09:10,058 --> 01:09:14,767
- Oh, Romy.
- Oh, please, go away.
Just leave me alone.

981
01:09:15,939 --> 01:09:18,975
Why did I even
come back here?

982
01:09:19,109 --> 01:09:21,778
Well, you know what? There are worse
things than telling some dumb story...

983
01:09:21,903 --> 01:09:23,861
and having everybody
laugh at you.

984
01:09:23,989 --> 01:09:29,493
- Like what?
- Like losing your best friend.

985
01:09:29,619 --> 01:09:31,493
You know? I mean,
I had the worst dream, Romy.

986
01:09:31,621 --> 01:09:35,915
I dreamt that we weren't friends
and we were really, really old.

987
01:09:36,043 --> 01:09:38,712
But I mean, like, we were, like,
really, really old.

988
01:09:38,837 --> 01:09:40,877
And-And we weren't friends.

989
01:09:42,924 --> 01:09:46,175
I can't stand that
we're mad at each other.

990
01:09:46,303 --> 01:09:49,257
Okay, I'm sorry
I said all those things.

991
01:09:49,389 --> 01:09:52,224
You're as cute as me.
You are.

992
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:56,134
And-And in some cultures,
maybe cuter.

993
01:09:56,271 --> 01:09:58,679
I'm sorry too.

994
01:09:58,815 --> 01:10:02,979
I shouldn't have said that you weren't
smart enough to invent Post-lts.

995
01:10:03,111 --> 01:10:05,982
Well, I mean,
maybe I'm not.

996
01:10:06,114 --> 01:10:09,982
Although in my dream,
I did know the formula for glue.

997
01:10:13,663 --> 01:10:15,989
So, are we friends again?

998
01:10:17,793 --> 01:10:19,666
Well, duh.

999
01:10:22,005 --> 01:10:23,914
Okay.

1000
01:10:24,049 --> 01:10:25,923
And you know what,
it doesn't even matter...

1001
01:10:26,051 --> 01:10:29,254
that we told, like, what,
four people some dumb lie.

1002
01:10:29,388 --> 01:10:31,713
Who cares?

1003
01:10:31,848 --> 01:10:34,518
Hi, everybody.

1004
01:10:34,643 --> 01:10:37,893
Settle down. Hi.

1005
01:10:38,021 --> 01:10:41,639
I'm Christie
Masters-Christianson.

1006
01:10:44,319 --> 01:10:47,190
I have been asked
to formally welcome you all...

1007
01:10:47,322 --> 01:10:50,987
to Sagebrush High's
ten-year reunion.

1008
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:01,160
We have come a long way
in the past ten years.

1009
01:11:01,294 --> 01:11:04,248
Our own Lisa Luder is helping
set the style for the country...

1010
01:11:04,381 --> 01:11:07,002
as a fashion editor
for "Vogue" magazine.

1011
01:11:15,892 --> 01:11:18,514
And Travis McKinney
is in his fifth year...

1012
01:11:18,645 --> 01:11:21,895
as a member of the
Dallas Cowboys football team.

1013
01:11:26,236 --> 01:11:27,101
And...

1014
01:11:27,237 --> 01:11:29,609
Romy and Michele claimed...

1015
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:32,444
they invented Post-lts.

1016
01:11:52,763 --> 01:11:54,636
All I ever wanted was
for people to think...

1017
01:11:54,765 --> 01:11:56,638
that we were better
than we were in high school.

1018
01:11:56,767 --> 01:12:00,136
And now we're just a stupid joke,
just like we always were.

1019
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:04,601
No, Romy.

1020
01:12:05,650 --> 01:12:07,608
Can I tell you the truth?

1021
01:12:09,279 --> 01:12:12,730
I never knew that we weren't
that great in high school.

1022
01:12:12,866 --> 01:12:15,238
I mean, we always had
so much fun together.

1023
01:12:15,369 --> 01:12:17,361
I thought high school
was a blast.

1024
01:12:17,496 --> 01:12:20,662
And until you told me that
our lives weren't good enough...

1025
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:24,325
I thought everything
since high school was a blast.

1026
01:12:24,461 --> 01:12:27,166
I think we should go back
out there as ourselves...

1027
01:12:27,297 --> 01:12:30,168
and just have fun
like we always do.

1028
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:32,293
The hell with
everyone else.

1029
01:12:32,427 --> 01:12:35,214
I don't think I can.

1030
01:12:35,347 --> 01:12:38,550
Well, do you think you can
stop being such a baby?

1031
01:12:39,851 --> 01:12:41,725
God, I feel like
I've been, like...

1032
01:12:41,853 --> 01:12:43,727
chasing you all over
this reunion.

1033
01:12:43,855 --> 01:12:45,729
We have come
all this way.

1034
01:12:45,857 --> 01:12:50,519
Now we are going to enjoy ourselves
whether you like it or not.

1035
01:12:50,654 --> 01:12:54,604
God, Michele, I've never seen this side
of your personality before.

1036
01:12:54,741 --> 01:12:56,698
You're so bossy
and domineering.

1037
01:12:58,328 --> 01:13:02,408
- I like it.
- Me too.

1038
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:11,454
She's got it

1039
01:13:11,591 --> 01:13:14,462
Yeah, baby
she's got it

1040
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:19,671
- I don't believe it.
- What?

1041
01:13:19,808 --> 01:13:21,183
They're ba-ack.

1042
01:13:23,854 --> 01:13:25,396
Well, I'm your Venus

1043
01:13:25,522 --> 01:13:27,396
- Nice outfits.
- I'm your fire

1044
01:13:27,524 --> 01:13:30,395
Post-lts must be
really lucrative.

1045
01:13:37,576 --> 01:13:40,245
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- Oh, yeah, Michele, I am so sure.

1046
01:13:42,831 --> 01:13:45,369
What the hell is
your problem, Christie?

1047
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,872
Why are you always
such a nasty bitch?

1048
01:13:49,588 --> 01:13:52,423
Do you get some kind of sick pleasure
from torturing other people?

1049
01:13:52,549 --> 01:13:56,084
I mean, yeah, okay, so Michele and I
did make up some lame story.

1050
01:13:56,219 --> 01:13:58,924
We only did it because we wanted you
to treat us like human beings.

1051
01:13:59,056 --> 01:14:00,929
But you know what
I finally realized?

1052
01:14:01,058 --> 01:14:04,142
I don't care if you like us
'cause we don't like you.

1053
01:14:04,269 --> 01:14:06,143
You're a bad person
with an ugly heart...

1054
01:14:06,271 --> 01:14:09,142
and we don't give a flying fuck
what you think.

1055
01:14:14,988 --> 01:14:17,609
- Come on, Michele.
- Okay.

1056
01:14:17,741 --> 01:14:20,493
And, yeah.

1057
01:14:20,619 --> 01:14:23,655
It's unbelievable.
They're as deluded about their lives...

1058
01:14:23,789 --> 01:14:25,828
as they are about
those hideous clothes.

1059
01:14:27,751 --> 01:14:30,954
Actually, Christie,
they've got nice lines...

1060
01:14:31,088 --> 01:14:33,294
a fun,
frisky use of colour.

1061
01:14:33,423 --> 01:14:37,753
All in all, I'd have to say
they're really not bad.

1062
01:14:47,562 --> 01:14:51,311
Well, we still think
they're ridiculous.

1063
01:14:51,441 --> 01:14:53,315
Don't we, girls?

1064
01:14:59,449 --> 01:15:02,652
Why don't you just let them
think for themselves for once?

1065
01:15:02,786 --> 01:15:05,277
You're just jealous...

1066
01:15:05,414 --> 01:15:10,704
because unlike a certain ball-busting,
dried-up career woman I might mention...

1067
01:15:10,836 --> 01:15:13,208
we're all happily married.

1068
01:15:13,338 --> 01:15:15,497
That's right, Christie.

1069
01:15:15,632 --> 01:15:17,708
Keep telling
yourself that.

1070
01:15:30,021 --> 01:15:32,857
- I do love those outfits.
- Yeah, sure do.

1071
01:15:32,983 --> 01:15:34,892
- Oh, great.
- Thanks.

1072
01:15:35,026 --> 01:15:37,019
Michele made them.

1073
01:15:37,154 --> 01:15:41,021
Well, I just sewed them.
We both designed them.

1074
01:15:41,158 --> 01:15:43,827
- Fifty-fifty.
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1075
01:15:43,952 --> 01:15:45,660
That's so cool.

1076
01:15:47,289 --> 01:15:49,246
Well, it's been really
terrific seeing all of you.

1077
01:15:49,374 --> 01:15:51,533
- Come on, Michele.
- Oh, okay, bye.

1078
01:15:52,627 --> 01:15:53,493
Hi.

1079
01:15:55,213 --> 01:15:59,543
I am sorry that I blew
your big lie for you.

1080
01:15:59,676 --> 01:16:03,377
Hey, that's okay.
It was better this way anyway.

1081
01:16:03,513 --> 01:16:07,725
It's ironic, isn't it? I really thought
you guys had it made in high school.

1082
01:16:07,851 --> 01:16:09,511
- Us?
- Yes, you.

1083
01:16:09,644 --> 01:16:12,432
With your long hair
and your long legs...

1084
01:16:12,564 --> 01:16:14,687
walking on your legs,
flipping your hair.

1085
01:16:14,816 --> 01:16:16,725
I can't compete with that.
You made Sandy crazy.

1086
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:19,433
And the whole time
you were making my life hell...

1087
01:16:19,571 --> 01:16:22,062
the "A" group was making
your life hell; I didn't know.

1088
01:16:22,199 --> 01:16:26,742
You know what? I bet in high school
everybody made somebody's life hell.

1089
01:16:26,870 --> 01:16:31,117
Mm-mmm, not me. Never had the
opportunity to make anyone's life hell.

1090
01:16:31,249 --> 01:16:34,749
You know what? I bet that's not true.
You were really unpleasant.

1091
01:16:34,878 --> 01:16:36,752
- You think?
- Oh, yeah. God.

1092
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,086
Heather?
Oh, I'm off duty.

1093
01:16:39,216 --> 01:16:41,885
Um, since you never
got around to it in high school...

1094
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:44,584
I was wondering
if you could sign my yearbook.

1095
01:16:44,721 --> 01:16:47,841
And, uh, please don't
tell me to fuck off...

1096
01:16:47,974 --> 01:16:49,932
because it really hurts
my feelings.

1097
01:16:51,311 --> 01:16:54,478
- I hurt your feelings?
- Yeah, all the time.

1098
01:16:54,606 --> 01:16:57,477
Tremendous!
That's tremendous!

1099
01:16:57,609 --> 01:17:00,147
Go get your stupid yearbook.
I would be happy to sign it.

1100
01:17:00,278 --> 01:17:04,062
Okay, great.
I'll-I'll be right back, okay?

1101
01:17:04,199 --> 01:17:07,034
Michele, I think maybe
we should leave.

1102
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:09,651
There is no way this reunion
is going to get any better.

1103
01:17:09,788 --> 01:17:14,829
Hey, everybody, Sandy Frink
just landed in a helicopter!

1104
01:17:15,961 --> 01:17:18,000
Sandy Frink
has a helicopter?

1105
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:19,956
Yeah. Apparently he's worth,
like, millions.

1106
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:23,625
He invented some kind of
special rubber or something.

1107
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,334
Like for condoms?

1108
01:17:31,184 --> 01:17:34,055
Whoa-ohh-ohh

1109
01:17:37,941 --> 01:17:41,310
The hot summer night

1110
01:17:41,445 --> 01:17:43,817
Fell like a net

1111
01:17:45,449 --> 01:17:49,826
I've got to find
my baby yet

1112
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:54,664
You think I'm cute

1113
01:17:54,791 --> 01:17:58,041
A little bit shy

1114
01:17:58,170 --> 01:18:02,915
Mama, I ain't
that kind of guy

1115
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:07,546
That's Sandy Frink?
What the hell was I thinking?

1116
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:09,138
Whoa-ohh-ohh

1117
01:18:13,977 --> 01:18:15,851
Sandy, hi.

1118
01:18:15,979 --> 01:18:18,055
- Doctor, Doctor, give me the news
- You look so rich.

1119
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:22,353
- I got a bad case of loving you
- I mean, great.

1120
01:18:22,486 --> 01:18:24,692
No pill's going to
cure my ill

1121
01:18:24,821 --> 01:18:30,492
I got a bad case
of loving you

1122
01:18:31,995 --> 01:18:34,320
Michele.

1123
01:18:34,456 --> 01:18:39,581
- After all these years,
you still take my breath away.
- Thanks.

1124
01:18:39,711 --> 01:18:43,163
So you must be, like,
the most successful person...

1125
01:18:43,298 --> 01:18:45,207
in our entire
graduating class.

1126
01:18:46,676 --> 01:18:49,880
Well, I guess that depends
on how you define "success."

1127
01:18:50,013 --> 01:18:53,714
If, to you, success means
having a house in Aspen...

1128
01:18:53,850 --> 01:18:57,682
one in Acapulco, a penthouse in
New York, a mansion in Malibu...

1129
01:18:57,813 --> 01:19:00,434
a 60-foot yacht,
an eight-seat Windstar...

1130
01:19:00,565 --> 01:19:03,566
a Bell Jet Ranger, a Bentley,
a personal trainer, a full-time chef...

1131
01:19:03,693 --> 01:19:05,567
a live-in masseuse
and a staff of 24...

1132
01:19:05,695 --> 01:19:07,902
then, yeah...

1133
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:10,107
I guess I am successful.

1134
01:19:11,868 --> 01:19:15,202
But no matter
how much I accumulate...

1135
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:18,580
there's still one thing
I just don't have.

1136
01:19:19,751 --> 01:19:21,411
Your own country?

1137
01:19:23,672 --> 01:19:25,711
I don't have you,
Michele.

1138
01:19:29,511 --> 01:19:31,468
Will you dance with me?

1139
01:19:33,598 --> 01:19:37,217
Only if Romy
can dance with us.

1140
01:19:37,352 --> 01:19:39,226
Sure.

1141
01:19:57,789 --> 01:19:59,996
Lying in my bed

1142
01:20:00,125 --> 01:20:05,001
I hear the clock tick
and think of you

1143
01:20:05,130 --> 01:20:08,001
Caught up in circles

1144
01:20:08,133 --> 01:20:12,131
Confusion is nothing new

1145
01:20:12,262 --> 01:20:16,342
Flashback
Warm nights

1146
01:20:16,475 --> 01:20:19,594
Almost left behind

1147
01:20:19,728 --> 01:20:23,678
Suitcase of memories

1148
01:20:23,815 --> 01:20:28,358
Time after
Sometimes you picture me

1149
01:20:28,487 --> 01:20:32,319
I'm walking
too far ahead

1150
01:20:32,449 --> 01:20:35,485
You're calling to me

1151
01:20:35,619 --> 01:20:39,830
I can't hear
what you've said

1152
01:20:39,956 --> 01:20:44,168
Then you say "Go slow"

1153
01:20:44,294 --> 01:20:47,497
I fall behind

1154
01:20:47,631 --> 01:20:50,204
The second hand unwinds

1155
01:20:50,342 --> 01:20:54,885
If you're lost, you can look
and you will find me

1156
01:20:55,013 --> 01:20:57,718
Time after time

1157
01:20:57,849 --> 01:21:02,179
If you fall, I will catch you
I'll be waiting

1158
01:21:02,312 --> 01:21:05,017
Time after time

1159
01:21:05,148 --> 01:21:09,644
If you're lost, you can look
and you will find me

1160
01:21:09,778 --> 01:21:12,186
Time after time

1161
01:21:12,322 --> 01:21:14,196
If you fall
I will catch you

1162
01:21:14,324 --> 01:21:16,993
- I'll be waiting
- I will be waiting

1163
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:18,696
Time after time

1164
01:21:20,831 --> 01:21:22,704
Time after time

1165
01:21:24,501 --> 01:21:26,541
Time after time

1166
01:21:28,171 --> 01:21:31,208
Time after time

1167
01:21:31,341 --> 01:21:33,713
Time after time

1168
01:21:35,345 --> 01:21:37,421
See, I told you
it would pay off...

1169
01:21:37,556 --> 01:21:39,928
to go to those clubs
every night.

1170
01:21:45,021 --> 01:21:46,220
Come on.

1171
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:52,862
Oh, Jesus,
Mary and Joseph.

1172
01:21:52,988 --> 01:21:54,897
What do you want?

1173
01:21:55,031 --> 01:21:58,566
You were right. I was
a brain-dead, redneck asshole.

1174
01:21:58,702 --> 01:22:00,741
Although I never screwed
a sheep or my sister.

1175
01:22:00,871 --> 01:22:03,029
Why not?
Couldn't catch them?

1176
01:22:03,165 --> 01:22:07,245
I guess I deserve that.
I was a jerk.

1177
01:22:09,046 --> 01:22:10,919
But I was so miserable
in high school...

1178
01:22:11,048 --> 01:22:14,048
I don't think I spoke more than
two words the entire time.

1179
01:22:14,176 --> 01:22:18,256
I just couldn't
breathe there, you know?

1180
01:22:18,388 --> 01:22:20,760
Plus, I had this
really bad stutter.

1181
01:22:22,309 --> 01:22:25,892
Listen, you, uh,
want to go somewhere quiet?

1182
01:22:26,021 --> 01:22:28,097
Somewhere
where we can talk?

1183
01:22:28,231 --> 01:22:31,647
- You-You want to talk to me?
- Yeah.

1184
01:22:33,070 --> 01:22:35,192
Okay, cowboy, I don't know
what your trip is...

1185
01:22:35,322 --> 01:22:38,276
- but if this is some kind
of a sick game--
- What? No.

1186
01:22:38,408 --> 01:22:41,113
If you fuck with me
in any way, I will rip...

1187
01:22:41,244 --> 01:22:44,495
each and every appendage from your body,
starting with your dick, capisce?

1188
01:22:45,916 --> 01:22:49,616
Look, I j-just
w-wanted to talk.

1189
01:22:52,589 --> 01:22:54,629
Okay.

1190
01:22:54,758 --> 01:22:56,667
What the hell.

1191
01:22:57,844 --> 01:22:59,220
What is your name?

1192
01:22:59,346 --> 01:23:01,220
- Clarence.
- I like your hat, Clarence.

1193
01:23:01,348 --> 01:23:03,257
- Thank you.
- Pick up the pace.

1194
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:16,398
You wait here.
I'll prep my chopper.

1195
01:23:16,530 --> 01:23:18,403
- Okay.
- All right.

1196
01:23:20,242 --> 01:23:23,077
Oh, my God, somebody's
puking in the bushes.

1197
01:23:23,203 --> 01:23:25,077
Eeewww!

1198
01:23:28,125 --> 01:23:30,331
Hey, how you guys doing?

1199
01:23:31,253 --> 01:23:32,628
Billy?

1200
01:23:33,797 --> 01:23:37,332
- Chubbo?
- The name is Romy.

1201
01:23:39,052 --> 01:23:41,045
Romy and Michele.

1202
01:23:42,806 --> 01:23:47,302
So, weren't you guys, like,
totally in love with me in high school?

1203
01:23:47,436 --> 01:23:49,559
She was.

1204
01:23:56,486 --> 01:23:58,693
You want to get a room?

1205
01:23:58,822 --> 01:24:01,147
But you're married.

1206
01:24:01,283 --> 01:24:04,699
- To Christie.
- Yeah, but you've got children...

1207
01:24:04,828 --> 01:24:07,995
and you're a successful
real estate developer.

1208
01:24:09,624 --> 01:24:13,207
I do drywall for her old man's
construction company.

1209
01:24:13,336 --> 01:24:17,037
And-And you know this new kid?
Don't even know if he's mine.

1210
01:24:18,884 --> 01:24:20,757
So--

1211
01:24:20,886 --> 01:24:23,174
How about that room?

1212
01:24:27,893 --> 01:24:29,766
Okay.

1213
01:24:31,730 --> 01:24:34,351
Why don't you go
and get that room?

1214
01:24:34,483 --> 01:24:38,065
Go and wash your face
and take off all your clothes...

1215
01:24:38,195 --> 01:24:40,234
and I'll be up there
in five minutes.

1216
01:24:40,363 --> 01:24:42,071
All right!

1217
01:24:43,325 --> 01:24:47,073
Your fantasy
is going to come true...

1218
01:24:47,204 --> 01:24:49,243
tonight.

1219
01:24:50,707 --> 01:24:52,914
- See you later.
- Ugh-- Okay.

1220
01:25:00,050 --> 01:25:04,427
- God.
- Now he's going to see what
it feels like to wait.

1221
01:25:04,554 --> 01:25:07,389
- That's such a good one.
- Ladies.

1222
01:25:09,518 --> 01:25:14,892
- God, can you believe we're
going home in a helicopter?
- I know. It's so cool.

1223
01:25:15,023 --> 01:25:18,558
I just wish everybody inside the reunion
would come out and see us lift off.

1224
01:25:18,693 --> 01:25:20,236
Ohh!

1225
01:25:20,362 --> 01:25:22,236
Thank you.

1226
01:25:25,659 --> 01:25:27,236
Oh.

1227
01:25:32,541 --> 01:25:37,286
Oh, my God! I'm so glad you didn't
bring your big notebook with you.

1228
01:25:37,421 --> 01:25:39,081
Michele.

1229
01:25:39,214 --> 01:25:42,915
Ooh, baby, do you know
what that's worth

1230
01:25:43,051 --> 01:25:46,966
Ooh, heaven is
a place on earth

1231
01:25:47,097 --> 01:25:50,632
They say in heaven
love comes first

1232
01:25:50,767 --> 01:25:54,136
We'll make heaven
a place on earth

1233
01:25:54,271 --> 01:25:57,806
Ooh, heaven is
a place on earth

1234
01:25:57,941 --> 01:26:01,357
Billy. Billy!

1235
01:26:01,486 --> 01:26:03,977
Billy, where are you?

1236
01:26:05,115 --> 01:26:08,614
Billy. Damn it.
Damn it!

1237
01:26:15,292 --> 01:26:17,450
Oh, my God.
Is that Heather?

1238
01:26:17,586 --> 01:26:20,373
Go for it, Heather!

1239
01:26:20,505 --> 01:26:23,839
Ooh, baby, do you know
what that's worth

1240
01:26:25,218 --> 01:26:27,626
Ooh, heaven is
a place on earth

1241
01:26:27,763 --> 01:26:31,381
They say in heaven
love comes first

1242
01:26:31,516 --> 01:26:33,390
Thanks for stopping by.

1243
01:26:33,518 --> 01:26:35,511
Yeah. Enjoy your fashions.

1244
01:26:35,645 --> 01:26:37,519
Have a Romy and Michele day.

1245
01:26:37,647 --> 01:26:40,185
- That was a good one.
- Thanks.

1246
01:26:40,317 --> 01:26:42,642
I cannot believe
how busy we've been.

1247
01:26:42,778 --> 01:26:46,645
I know. Hey, maybe we can
pay back Sandy this week.

1248
01:26:46,782 --> 01:26:49,736
Um, I think we're about, like,
two years away from that.

1249
01:26:49,868 --> 01:26:52,703
Oh. Okay.

1250
01:26:59,169 --> 01:27:02,704
Heather, um, has anyone ever told you
that smoking can kill you?

1251
01:27:02,839 --> 01:27:06,006
No. No one. Thank you.

1252
01:27:06,134 --> 01:27:08,708
Okay, but if you burn it,
you bought it.

1253
01:27:08,845 --> 01:27:11,336
Like I give a shit.
I look like an asshole.

1254
01:27:11,473 --> 01:27:13,715
What? Nuh-uh.
You look totally cute.

1255
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:18,393
This dress exacerbates the genetic
betrayal that is my legacy.

1256
01:27:18,522 --> 01:27:20,847
Okay, I don't even know what you're
talking about because of those words...

1257
01:27:20,982 --> 01:27:22,856
but come here.

1258
01:27:22,984 --> 01:27:26,069
- Ow!
- God, that has been bugging me.

1259
01:27:26,196 --> 01:27:29,945
- Stay away from my bikini area.
- Um, okay.

1260
01:27:30,075 --> 01:27:33,242
- I'm in a rush. Ring it up if you must.
- Okay.

1261
01:27:33,370 --> 01:27:35,409
Let me have the tag, please.

1262
01:27:35,539 --> 01:27:37,412
Thank you.

1263
01:27:37,541 --> 01:27:39,414
You really do look cute.

1264
01:27:43,630 --> 01:27:46,002
- You know what?
- Huh?

1265
01:27:46,133 --> 01:27:50,380
Despite that surly demeanour, I think
we've just given her a big gift.

1266
01:27:50,512 --> 01:27:52,718
Okay, I mean,
to give someone...

1267
01:27:52,848 --> 01:27:56,430
like Heather Mooney the chance
to express herself through fashion--

1268
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:58,967
We could've really
changed her life.

1269
01:27:59,104 --> 01:28:02,188
Yeah. For me though,
it's like...

1270
01:28:02,315 --> 01:28:05,186
I've given birth to
my own baby girl, you know?

1271
01:28:05,318 --> 01:28:07,358
Only she's, like,
a big giant girl...

1272
01:28:07,487 --> 01:28:10,358
who smokes
and says "shit" a lot.

1273
01:28:10,490 --> 01:28:13,444
- You know?
- Yeah.

1274
01:28:13,577 --> 01:28:17,242
- Yeah. Let's fold scarves!
- Okay.

1275
01:28:19,791 --> 01:28:21,665
- You know what, Michele?
- Huh?

1276
01:28:21,793 --> 01:28:24,284
I think you are, like,
the funnest person I know.

1277
01:28:24,421 --> 01:28:26,627
Me too.
With you.

1278
01:28:35,474 --> 01:28:38,475
See the people
walking down the street

1279
01:28:38,602 --> 01:28:41,638
Fall in line
Just watching all the feet

1280
01:28:41,772 --> 01:28:44,310
They don't know
where everyone can go

1281
01:28:44,441 --> 01:28:46,849
But they're walking
in time

1282
01:28:46,985 --> 01:28:49,654
They got the beat
They got the beat

1283
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:54,323
They got the beat
Yeah, they got the beat

1284
01:29:00,791 --> 01:29:03,827
All the kids
just getting out of school

1285
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:06,997
They can't wait
to hang out and be cool

1286
01:29:07,130 --> 01:29:09,337
Hang around
till quarter after twelve

1287
01:29:09,466 --> 01:29:12,171
That's when
they fall in line

1288
01:29:12,302 --> 01:29:14,674
They got the beat
They got the beat

1289
01:29:14,805 --> 01:29:19,680
Kids got the beat
Yeah, kids got the beat

1290
01:29:38,495 --> 01:29:41,662
Go-go music
really makes us dance

1291
01:29:41,790 --> 01:29:44,826
In the crowd
it puts us in a trance

1292
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,166
We want to
So just give us a chance

1293
01:29:47,295 --> 01:29:50,000
That's when
we fall in line

1294
01:29:50,132 --> 01:29:52,670
'Cause we got the beat
We got the beat

1295
01:29:52,801 --> 01:29:57,510
We got the beat
Yeah, we got it

1296
01:29:59,224 --> 01:30:01,098
We got the beat

1297
01:30:02,602 --> 01:30:05,722
- We got the beat
- Everybody get out your feet

1298
01:30:05,856 --> 01:30:08,857
- We got the beat
- We know you can dance to the beat

1299
01:30:08,984 --> 01:30:12,187
- We got the beat
- Jump back, kick 'round

1300
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:15,108
- We got the beat
- 'Round and 'round and 'round

1301
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:18,111
- Whoo!
- We got the beat

1302
01:30:18,243 --> 01:30:21,327
- We got the beat

1303
01:30:21,455 --> 01:30:23,661

1305
01:30:26,877 --> 01:30:29,165
