1
00:03:15,338 --> 00:03:16,921
What do you think of the car?

2
00:03:19,963 --> 00:03:22,921
Smooth as butter.

3
00:03:28,045 --> 00:03:30,087
Just like my wife.

4
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,753
You are too much sir.

5
00:03:34,752 --> 00:03:36,294
Just like your wife.

6
00:03:37,044 --> 00:03:38,586
How soon will it be ready?

7
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:42,044
It's a precision job.
The engine is great.

8
00:03:43,548 --> 00:03:45,048
It will take 10-12 days.

9
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:49,251
Deliver it at my house when it's ready.
- Okay.

10
00:03:51,293 --> 00:03:55,253
Well, the steering is fine.
Not to worry.

11
00:03:55,371 --> 00:03:56,880
That's what I feel.

12
00:03:58,148 --> 00:04:00,026
The roads here are quite shitty.

13
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,917
Of course boss, this car isn't
made for here.

14
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:05,666
Japan has fantastic roads.

15
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:11,499
Better than in America?
- Absolutely. Better than America.

16
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,470
Want a cigarette?
-Yes, definitely.

17
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,707
Thank you.

18
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,081
Why is this still here?
It doesn't even work. - Fix it.

19
00:04:28,581 --> 00:04:30,039
Sure thing.

20
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:34,663
What's that sound?
- What sound?

21
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:38,208
Listen.
- I can't hear anything.

22
00:04:41,142 --> 00:04:43,462
I think there's a problem with
the differential.

23
00:04:44,204 --> 00:04:47,454
I'll check it in the garage.
- Sure. - Okay.

24
00:04:49,787 --> 00:04:52,287
I'll check it out.

25
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:59,786
How dare that stupid Fiat
try to overtake me?

26
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:30,366
Watch out, hero.
What a strange mechanic!

27
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,156
Hi, Mr. Braganza.
- Hello, Albert.

28
00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:48,337
Is the car giving you trouble?

29
00:05:48,387 --> 00:05:50,847
- No, with you around,
what trouble will it give?

30
00:05:50,989 --> 00:05:53,697
Is your Mercedes doing fine?
- Yes, it is.

31
00:05:53,991 --> 00:05:56,032
How's everyone at home?
-fine.

32
00:05:58,004 --> 00:05:59,743
And how is Stella?
- She is fine.

33
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:00,694
And Dominic?

34
00:06:00,745 --> 00:06:04,369
That problem of yours..
- It has been solved. Thanks a lot.

35
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:07,071
I see. Go ahead.
I'm waiting for the bill.

36
00:06:07,154 --> 00:06:09,199
Okay, Mr. Braganza. Bye.
- Bye.

37
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,528
Buddy, bring me
a cup of special tea quickly.

38
00:06:23,002 --> 00:06:25,737
fast, fast.

39
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,693
Albert, your girlfriend had called.

40
00:06:35,318 --> 00:06:39,068
When?
- About 15 minutes back.

41
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,608
She said she can't meet you this
evening. She has to attend a party.

42
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:52,824
Must be a dance party.

43
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,074
why do you care?
I gave him the message na.

44
00:07:00,774 --> 00:07:04,731
Has this milk split?
what's this Seth (business owner)?

45
00:07:06,152 --> 00:07:09,442
The milk in my tea is okay.
Something's wrong with his.

46
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,764
Albert, what will you do
this evening?

47
00:07:18,398 --> 00:07:23,359
Don't charge me for this tea!
- Albert, what will you do this evening?

48
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:25,782
Albert!

49
00:07:25,997 --> 00:07:29,110
I will think about it.
I am not an alcoholic like you.

50
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,407
Every evening with
mosambi (country liquor).

51
00:07:32,021 --> 00:07:33,275
Rascal!

52
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,361
Buddy, pick up the chair.

53
00:08:01,643 --> 00:08:04,309
Move, move!
Can't you see the car?

54
00:08:38,443 --> 00:08:41,013
Why are you getting
involved in all of this?

55
00:08:41,185 --> 00:08:42,825
Please stay away from all of this.

56
00:08:43,138 --> 00:08:48,763
How can I stay away? I have to do
whatever the union decides.

57
00:08:48,941 --> 00:08:52,441
And is it that
we are demanding too much?

58
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:58,928
Are we asking for millions, or
a bungalow, or a car?

59
00:08:59,532 --> 00:09:02,384
We demand a respectful life. that's it.
- Damn the strike!

60
00:09:02,454 --> 00:09:04,411
Will being on strike
give you respect?

61
00:09:05,574 --> 00:09:10,074
Forget about the strike. Mom,
will I get tea? - Yes, right away.

62
00:09:10,504 --> 00:09:13,378
Let me pack his lunch.
He'll get late for work.

63
00:09:14,293 --> 00:09:18,677
Try to understand.
There is so much Inflation.

64
00:09:19,007 --> 00:09:21,350
Shouldn't our salaries
also increase accordingly?

65
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:25,342
Handsome salary and yearly bonus.
Can't we get that? - Yes, you can.

66
00:09:25,426 --> 00:09:26,759
But that's the union's job.

67
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:29,322
Let them ask,
why are you getting into it?

68
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:31,425
What if the mill shuts down?

69
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:34,341
Why would it?
We haven't threatened them.

70
00:09:34,716 --> 00:09:37,216
Moreover, we have..
- This happens all the time.

71
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,341
Your demands will never get met.

72
00:09:39,392 --> 00:09:41,342
Then you'll strike work.
The mill will be closed.

73
00:09:41,393 --> 00:09:44,183
I tell you the union
won't do anything.

74
00:09:44,254 --> 00:09:47,551
Mom, let him at least complete the point.
- What's the point?

75
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:49,997
Mom is absolutely right.

76
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,151
Calling for strike
is the work of crazy people.

77
00:09:55,456 --> 00:09:58,423
We aren't like them.
We are better off than them.

78
00:09:58,506 --> 00:10:01,089
Have your tea.
- Look at me.

79
00:10:03,204 --> 00:10:06,463
There was a strike at the garage.
I stayed away from it.

80
00:10:06,727 --> 00:10:09,963
I had nothing to do with it.
I do my job, I get my salary.

81
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:19,971
I'm the only mechanic in Mumbai who
delivers the car to the customer's house.

82
00:10:20,902 --> 00:10:22,526
I get to drive the car.

83
00:10:24,141 --> 00:10:27,686
I am acquainted with
several millionaires.

84
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:31,802
I don't address them formally.

85
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:35,953
I don't have to.
I call them by their first names.

86
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:38,514
Vivek, Murad, their first names.
Like that.

87
00:10:42,044 --> 00:10:44,294
Really Albert, you are
such a fool.

88
00:10:45,605 --> 00:10:48,440
What did you say?
- Fool.

89
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,441
You are the bane of my life.
You and Dominic.

90
00:10:57,421 --> 00:11:00,458
Mom, I spoke to Vivek
about a job for Dominic.

91
00:11:00,542 --> 00:11:02,323
He promised he would look in to it.

92
00:11:02,717 --> 00:11:07,633
Where is Dominic? Where is he?
- Who knows?

93
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:21,766
Aye, Dominic!

94
00:12:39,865 --> 00:12:41,447
Salaam Javed.
- Hi, Stella.

95
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:43,739
How are you, Stella?
- Fine.

96
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,884
How are you, Stella?
Albert is in the office.

97
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,415
Thank you, Madhu.

98
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,610
Hello Albert.

99
00:13:39,795 --> 00:13:41,461
Why didn't you answer my call?

100
00:13:44,058 --> 00:13:45,365
I was under the car.

101
00:13:47,852 --> 00:13:51,931
I have good news. I got a promotion.
- I see.

102
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,575
I'm a secretary to the boss now.
- When did the party get over?

103
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,990
Are you talking about the other night?
- Yes.

104
00:14:06,702 --> 00:14:09,112
At about 11:30 pm.

105
00:14:13,424 --> 00:14:14,816
How did you reach home?

106
00:14:17,742 --> 00:14:19,026
Arvind dropped me.

107
00:14:25,095 --> 00:14:27,865
Did you have fun? Did you?

108
00:14:30,055 --> 00:14:32,954
What fun?
All parties are similar.

109
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,338
Albert, I can't refuse
to attend the party.

110
00:14:43,547 --> 00:14:45,795
What would you do in my place?
-Did I stop you?

111
00:14:48,002 --> 00:14:50,163
why are you getting angry
unnecessarily?

112
00:14:52,494 --> 00:14:54,577
Okay tell me, what time
this evening?

113
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,525
I have loads of work.

114
00:14:58,299 --> 00:14:59,591
And tomorrow?

115
00:15:01,548 --> 00:15:05,090
Tomorrow also there's work.

116
00:15:06,332 --> 00:15:09,105
Will you let me know?

117
00:15:09,155 --> 00:15:12,655
This is done.
I'll call you if I get time.

118
00:15:15,363 --> 00:15:16,905
Okay?

119
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,923
Have you had lunch?
- Not yet.

120
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,638
Can I have lunch here?
- Yes, sure.

121
00:15:30,155 --> 00:15:32,655
Go ahead. Have I stopped you?

122
00:16:14,862 --> 00:16:18,127
Now a days there are
more meetings, less work, eh?

123
00:16:23,338 --> 00:16:24,879
Darn him.

124
00:16:45,957 --> 00:16:49,457
Please keep it away son,
you know Albert doesn't like it.

125
00:16:51,297 --> 00:16:55,855
"Okay, Albert doesn't like it."

126
00:16:55,937 --> 00:17:00,495
"Okay, Albert doesn't like it."

127
00:17:03,171 --> 00:17:08,963
"Doesn't like this,
Doesn't like that"

128
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:14,962
"You don't like anything I do."

129
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:22,127
"This belongs to Albert.
That belongs to Joan."

130
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:25,836
"Shall I help you?
Shall I sing a song?"

131
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,460
"Shall I help you?
Shall I sing a song?"

132
00:17:30,543 --> 00:17:34,010
"Shall I help you?"
- You're mad.

133
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:37,775
Nuts
-Nuts?

134
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:43,459
"Dominic is nuts."

135
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:46,501
So what? Who cares?
This world isn't for me.

136
00:17:46,584 --> 00:17:49,666
"This world isn't for me."

137
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:57,083
"This world belongs to
working men, famous men."

138
00:17:57,166 --> 00:18:01,207
"This world belongs to
working men, famous men."

139
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,838
That is right.

140
00:18:03,021 --> 00:18:07,602
You make fun of others
because you are jobless.

141
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:11,434
See Joan, she also works.
At least she does something.

142
00:18:11,914 --> 00:18:16,206
"Joan! Nuts."

143
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:20,622
"Dominic is nuts.
He is nuts."

144
00:18:21,247 --> 00:18:25,247
"Dominic is nuts.
He is nuts ."

145
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,600
I like the colour of your Saree.
Is there anything in that colour?

146
00:18:58,593 --> 00:19:01,342
Red? Let me check.

147
00:19:10,345 --> 00:19:12,178
Your taste is classy.

148
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:15,830
This is the color I want,
but the design isn't good.

149
00:19:16,587 --> 00:19:19,267
The sari is for my sister.

150
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:24,960
It's her birthday today.
Will you choose one for her?

151
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:31,814
You look so much like my sister.
In fact you look better.

152
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,342
See, this sari would be
good for your sister.

153
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:42,431
Great! That's the color I wanted.
Will you do me another favor?

154
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:46,429
What?

155
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:52,098
It's a small request.
Will you wear the sari for me?

156
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,855
I want to know how beautiful
my sister would look.

157
00:20:04,477 --> 00:20:09,101
I will wear it.
I'm like your sister, right?

158
00:20:13,534 --> 00:20:15,576
And your sister is like me.

159
00:20:18,046 --> 00:20:19,765
Just like me?

160
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:36,799
Is she lame like me too?

161
00:20:40,345 --> 00:20:42,135
Isn't she very pretty?

162
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,199
Is she also handicapped?

163
00:21:16,872 --> 00:21:19,746
Just five more minutes, Albert.
This is the last letter.

164
00:21:21,475 --> 00:21:23,225
Yeah, that's alright.

165
00:21:50,739 --> 00:21:55,864
Well, forget it.
I'll complete it tomorrow.

166
00:22:02,868 --> 00:22:07,825
"Let our flag always fly high."

167
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:12,059
Bombay.

168
00:22:12,955 --> 00:22:14,705
Where is Europe?

169
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:18,520
Where are we going this evening?
London or Paris?

170
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:22,629
Bombay is the best.

171
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:29,347
Right? Our Bombay is best.

172
00:22:32,344 --> 00:22:35,272
Stella, why are you still here?

173
00:22:37,483 --> 00:22:41,045
I make you work too hard.
I'll take you out for a movie today.

174
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:46,353
If you refuse, I'll carry you out.

175
00:22:46,629 --> 00:22:50,293
No. Arvind...
I can't come.

176
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,009
why?

177
00:22:52,612 --> 00:22:56,000
This is Albert.
Albert... Arvind.

178
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,880
So, you are the Albert.

179
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:06,004
I have heard a lot about you.
- I have also...

180
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:11,041
You should have told me earlier.
We'll see the film some other day.

181
00:23:15,042 --> 00:23:16,800
Let's go Albert.

182
00:23:20,129 --> 00:23:21,130
Stella.

183
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:26,948
When will you treat me with Goan food?
-After your trip to Singapore.

184
00:23:27,486 --> 00:23:29,486
Bye-bye.
- Okay.

185
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,380
What did I do?

186
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,840
What did I do?

187
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:47,026
You don't understand..

188
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,130
I cannot refuse to go.

189
00:23:49,797 --> 00:23:52,571
What would you do in my place?

190
00:23:52,629 --> 00:23:56,129
Stella, what would you do in my place?
Tell me that!

191
00:23:58,963 --> 00:24:00,628
I won't tolerate it.

192
00:24:03,629 --> 00:24:05,629
He talks rubbish.

193
00:24:06,954 --> 00:24:09,244
You can travel to Hong Kong and
Singapore with him.

194
00:24:09,295 --> 00:24:10,878
You get me wrong, Albert.

195
00:24:10,962 --> 00:24:14,377
I swear Arvind has never
misbehaved with me.

196
00:24:16,253 --> 00:24:20,669
He might not have.
But I know his type. All rascals.

197
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:25,644
What can I do if someone
wants to take me to the movies?

198
00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:29,293
He's no ordinary man.
He's Arvind sir, Arvind Sir.

199
00:24:29,376 --> 00:24:32,001
He's rich. He's a businessman.

200
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:38,249
Had I not been there, you would
have definitely gone with him.

201
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,259
Albert would be toiling
there in the garage.

202
00:24:41,317 --> 00:24:44,774
You would've called and
told me you can't come.

203
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:46,958
Don't lie Albert,
has it ever happened..

204
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:49,583
..that I promised to come with you,
but went away with him?

205
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:51,958
It was his idea to go
for a movie, not mine.

206
00:24:52,374 --> 00:24:55,916
So, you should have gone with him.
Why didn't you?

207
00:25:21,913 --> 00:25:25,413
In anger, you even stop thinking.
Will you even listen to me?

208
00:25:25,663 --> 00:25:29,079
He asked me out for a movie. I didn't.
- Yes, he asked you out.

209
00:25:29,162 --> 00:25:34,954
Why did he ask you? Why didn't he
ask me or others? Mind your dress.

210
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:42,036
It's blowing away. I told you
to wear a sari. But you never listen.

211
00:25:42,828 --> 00:25:46,952
The men on the streets are staring
at you. - You are crazy.

212
00:25:47,035 --> 00:25:50,202
I wear these dresses because
I like them. Not for others.

213
00:25:51,459 --> 00:25:54,959
You have a response to everything
Albert says.

214
00:25:55,992 --> 00:25:59,172
What happens to you
in Arvind's presence?

215
00:25:59,222 --> 00:26:01,422
Why were you shut then?

216
00:26:01,472 --> 00:26:07,179
Stop it. I can't listen to this.
- You have to. You have to listen to me.

217
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,616
Truth is always bitter.

218
00:26:11,366 --> 00:26:15,158
Don't cover your legs.
Why did you wear a skirt?

219
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:19,199
Let it fly.
Have a look at my girlfriend's legs.

220
00:26:19,282 --> 00:26:20,949
Constable, you too look.

221
00:26:23,574 --> 00:26:26,573
Darn it! Let it fly off.

222
00:26:29,364 --> 00:26:30,948
I want to go home.

223
00:27:00,031 --> 00:27:01,406
Stella is back.
- Yes.

224
00:27:01,489 --> 00:27:04,448
Fill the form.
She will get it typed tomorrow.

225
00:27:06,232 --> 00:27:09,524
My God! I forgot a certificate.
- What?

226
00:27:09,697 --> 00:27:13,103
Certificate.
-For god's sake you forgot the certificate?

227
00:27:13,154 --> 00:27:15,975
You are great. You think going
to Canada is just like that?

228
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:19,133
You don't understand.
How can you forget a certificate?

229
00:27:19,184 --> 00:27:21,526
Don't panic, dad.
- Panic? What panic?

230
00:27:21,762 --> 00:27:23,720
I'll get it done.
- All right.

231
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,981
What's wrong, Stella?

232
00:27:46,586 --> 00:27:49,878
I'll go fill the form quickly
and give it to Stella.

233
00:28:12,861 --> 00:28:16,515
What's wrong, Stella? Did you get
into a fight with Albert again?

234
00:28:18,677 --> 00:28:23,271
Alice, how do I look in these clothes?
- You look very beautiful.

235
00:28:26,537 --> 00:28:29,245
Really?
- Yes, you look very beautiful.

236
00:28:57,823 --> 00:28:59,281
Can I borrow Rs. 10?

237
00:29:23,813 --> 00:29:25,312
I'll return it tomorrow.

238
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,080
No need.

239
00:29:38,273 --> 00:29:40,360
Is my money bastardised?

240
00:29:52,403 --> 00:29:55,402
Joan, are you ashamed
that I am your brother?

241
00:30:01,013 --> 00:30:03,801
How does it matter
where I get the money from?

242
00:30:06,585 --> 00:30:10,210
Every person steals
in some way or other.

243
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:16,184
They steal for a living.
I say upfront that I steal.

244
00:30:18,876 --> 00:30:22,501
Everyone is trapped in their own traps.
I am the only free person.

245
00:30:25,631 --> 00:30:28,214
You are ashamed
to call me your brother?

246
00:30:37,183 --> 00:30:38,891
What exactly are you implying?

247
00:30:51,686 --> 00:30:54,519
Father, I tried very hard.

248
00:30:55,337 --> 00:31:00,296
I did everything,
but he doesn't listen.

249
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:04,961
What else do I do?

250
00:31:06,003 --> 00:31:11,753
Father, I'm very troubled
about Dominic.

251
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:16,609
What do I say to him?
How do I reform him?

252
00:31:17,328 --> 00:31:21,166
He has gone astray.
Father, what do I do?

253
00:31:22,409 --> 00:31:25,043
Don't worry. Have faith in God.

254
00:31:25,826 --> 00:31:28,159
He has given life.
He will show him the way.

255
00:31:28,376 --> 00:31:29,997
Father, I am tired.

256
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:33,080
He laughs at us.
He says we don't understand the world.

257
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:37,859
Father you say that God has made this
world for good people.

258
00:31:38,292 --> 00:31:43,624
You have to take efforts to become
a good person. But he makes fun of it.

259
00:31:45,491 --> 00:31:47,336
God moves in mysterious ways.

260
00:31:47,813 --> 00:31:51,197
You need to accept things
as they are.

261
00:31:52,029 --> 00:31:54,732
I know Dominic well.
He is a good person.

262
00:31:55,197 --> 00:31:56,697
Send him over to me.

263
00:31:57,412 --> 00:31:59,018
How do I do that?

264
00:31:59,864 --> 00:32:03,289
I tried a lot,
but he doesn't listen to me.

265
00:32:04,301 --> 00:32:10,175
Have faith in God. Pray that He will
put sense into him and save him.

266
00:32:12,252 --> 00:32:15,873
Yes, father.
Everything is in God's hand.

267
00:32:19,512 --> 00:32:21,975
Please don't worry, my child.

268
00:32:23,328 --> 00:32:24,870
Okay.

269
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:29,450
Everything is in God's hand.

270
00:32:55,108 --> 00:32:57,906
Uncle, you've got solid capacity.

271
00:32:59,501 --> 00:33:03,324
Before you take my daughter away,
you should have a small peg.

272
00:33:03,408 --> 00:33:06,241
No, uncle. Too much alcohol
will drive me crazy.

273
00:33:06,324 --> 00:33:11,036
Uncle, the movie..
That's enough. Last drink.

274
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:16,323
Drink it up, Albert.
One can't predict the future.

275
00:33:21,191 --> 00:33:23,315
Which car have you brought?
- Duke.

276
00:33:24,355 --> 00:33:26,674
Foreign car. Wonderful.

277
00:33:27,703 --> 00:33:30,906
Drive it for 20 years
and it still seems new. - Right.

278
00:33:31,383 --> 00:33:35,715
Then there are Indian cars.
Junk in just a year.

279
00:33:37,397 --> 00:33:40,564
And the roads are full of potholes.

280
00:33:41,156 --> 00:33:44,862
Uncle, this country...
only God can help.

281
00:33:45,672 --> 00:33:49,753
It is ruined. This country
has gone into the potholes.

282
00:33:51,425 --> 00:33:54,757
I had applied for a telephone
eight years back.

283
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:58,830
No phone, No tone,
nor any reply to my application.

284
00:34:00,823 --> 00:34:03,989
Apply, apply no reply.

285
00:34:05,556 --> 00:34:09,567
Uncle, you get a phone in two days
in foreign countries. - Yes.

286
00:34:09,735 --> 00:34:13,439
Here, you don't get gas connection for
two years, let alone phone connection.

287
00:34:13,526 --> 00:34:16,942
You don't get gas to cook.
What will people eat? Air?

288
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:22,483
Alice! Alice! Where is Stella?
Ask her to get ready.

289
00:34:23,351 --> 00:34:25,507
Are we going to the movies
today, or tomorrow?

290
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:28,385
Ruined.

291
00:34:29,163 --> 00:34:35,149
Jaundice, flu, eye disease, stomach
disorders and all diseases are here.

292
00:34:36,582 --> 00:34:40,382
The government tells people
to stay alert and get vaccinated.

293
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:42,606
And..

294
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,731
Boil water before drinking.

295
00:34:46,607 --> 00:34:50,606
How do you boil water?
There is no cooking gas.

296
00:34:52,095 --> 00:34:55,025
The British era was fantastic.

297
00:34:56,857 --> 00:35:01,435
Now you see India time,
Mumbai is now a slum.

298
00:35:02,657 --> 00:35:05,937
Why just Mumbai,
entire India is one big slum.

299
00:35:12,526 --> 00:35:15,340
I hope we could
go to a foreign country.

300
00:35:17,595 --> 00:35:19,178
Stella is here.

301
00:35:20,437 --> 00:35:22,811
Sorry, Albert.
- It's okay.

302
00:35:26,009 --> 00:35:29,227
We will make it at
least till intermission.

303
00:35:29,814 --> 00:35:32,900
Okay, uncle. Bye. - Bye.
- Take care. Don't get drunk.

304
00:35:33,053 --> 00:35:34,553
Bye.
-Bye Stella.

305
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,843
Take care of the potholes, Albert.

306
00:36:36,437 --> 00:36:37,728
Dominic.

307
00:36:44,051 --> 00:36:47,879
Careful. Be Alert.
It's merch, it's merch!

308
00:36:48,927 --> 00:36:54,760
It's a matter of stomach. Got that?
It's a matter of stomach. - Okay, boss.

309
00:36:56,949 --> 00:37:01,422
Seth Dharam Singh Gokuldas
is hanging out here with us?

310
00:37:01,884 --> 00:37:06,592
He belongs to the same caste
as we do. - Which is that, boss?

311
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,384
Both thieves.

312
00:37:10,884 --> 00:37:14,508
What are you doing?
- I'm reading.

313
00:37:14,591 --> 00:37:18,424
Reading? Do you know what happens?
- Yes, boss.

314
00:37:18,508 --> 00:37:19,508
Tell me.

315
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:27,173
"I will read(study) for years.
When I get the degree, it would just rot!"

316
00:37:27,257 --> 00:37:31,881
Even if you get a job,
- Blood will boil, you will swat away.

317
00:37:32,214 --> 00:37:34,297
You will work,
continue working.

318
00:37:34,547 --> 00:37:37,506
And what will you get?
- Nothing. - Nothing at all.

319
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:42,296
Soon after you will die.

320
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:46,338
Learn from the street.
Learn from the gutters.

321
00:37:46,946 --> 00:37:50,296
..wrongdoings, riots and thefts.

322
00:37:50,505 --> 00:37:52,254
Audacity.
- Learn thoroughly.

323
00:37:52,337 --> 00:37:55,837
Bullying, Bloodshed,
Slitting the throat.

324
00:37:59,265 --> 00:38:00,723
Without a knife.

325
00:38:08,113 --> 00:38:11,458
There's only one thing right.
Right now, right here.

326
00:38:12,134 --> 00:38:15,801
There's only one thing right.
Right now, right here.

327
00:38:20,725 --> 00:38:22,891
It was a good movie. Nice.

328
00:38:26,617 --> 00:38:29,322
It was a laugh riot.
My stomach hurts laughing. Robert.

329
00:38:30,316 --> 00:38:33,214
He acts so well.
- I didn't like it.

330
00:38:34,193 --> 00:38:36,250
Why don't you take me
to a different movie?

331
00:38:36,301 --> 00:38:38,240
All the movies are similar.

332
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:42,332
Boy sees girl.
They fall in love. They sing a song.

333
00:38:42,383 --> 00:38:44,091
Some melodrama and
then they get married.

334
00:38:44,142 --> 00:38:49,370
Yeah, that all is fine, but this movie
had great music.

335
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:51,581
Good. Good music.

336
00:38:52,123 --> 00:38:53,956
Like Goan folk song.
- Right.

337
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:59,039
In movies, a Goan or Christian is always
shown singing, eating and drinking.

338
00:38:59,123 --> 00:39:00,128
Why?

339
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:03,720
Doesn't he have any problems?
Does God give him everything?

340
00:39:06,949 --> 00:39:08,122
You are stupid.

341
00:39:08,499 --> 00:39:12,204
This is all just timepass.
People come out and forget it.

342
00:39:12,523 --> 00:39:15,172
Do you really think people
forget what they see in a movie?

343
00:39:15,223 --> 00:39:16,945
Have you seen kids in our locality?

344
00:39:17,266 --> 00:39:19,153
Every kid remembers
the dialogues of 'Sholay'.

345
00:39:19,204 --> 00:39:22,911
Why not?
- 'Hey Sambha! How many were they?'

346
00:39:22,995 --> 00:39:25,245
'What about you, Kalia?'

347
00:39:27,191 --> 00:39:31,285
Listen, let me tell you something.
And it's the truth.

348
00:39:32,689 --> 00:39:34,910
What else is their in our country?

349
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:39,202
Movies make
millions of people happy.

350
00:39:39,285 --> 00:39:43,082
They forget their sorrows.
They don't want to cry there too.

351
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:51,387
What's wrong with the car?

352
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:56,450
What is it?

353
00:40:48,709 --> 00:40:50,291
Has your car broken down?

354
00:40:50,611 --> 00:40:53,060
Do you want us to give it a push?
- No, no, no need.

355
00:40:53,111 --> 00:40:56,611
Hey, please step back a bit.
-Do you have enough petrol sir?

356
00:40:57,069 --> 00:40:59,277
Let me work.
- Have we stopped you?

357
00:41:00,283 --> 00:41:03,783
What a car..
-hey you, hey you.

358
00:41:05,485 --> 00:41:07,943
He's bullying us.
- It's a shiny car.

359
00:41:08,026 --> 00:41:09,900
It's a rocket.

360
00:41:10,979 --> 00:41:13,707
Must be at least 200,000.

361
00:41:14,677 --> 00:41:17,987
It's Rs. 500,000. - How can a car
worth Rs. 500,000 break down?

362
00:41:20,274 --> 00:41:23,524
Gundya, let's go.
- Sir, is this your car?

363
00:41:28,149 --> 00:41:32,107
Gundya, let's go.
We have a train to catch.

364
00:42:11,735 --> 00:42:15,819
Joan! - Yes?
-What is today's latest news?

365
00:42:17,515 --> 00:42:19,352
Latest news?

366
00:42:24,152 --> 00:42:29,160
The government is going to make
another small car for the people.

367
00:42:31,075 --> 00:42:33,069
Is this latest news?

368
00:42:34,471 --> 00:42:35,805
Okay, listen to this.

369
00:42:36,577 --> 00:42:38,869
Floods in Bihar leaves
millions homeless.

370
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:42,624
The minister watched those places
from a helicopter.

371
00:42:43,439 --> 00:42:45,433
Did he get down or stayed up there?

372
00:42:45,683 --> 00:42:47,978
He got down in Patna.

373
00:42:49,765 --> 00:42:51,231
Where else could he get down?

374
00:42:52,211 --> 00:42:55,419
Joan, has Albert
come out of the bathroom?

375
00:42:56,637 --> 00:43:01,108
It is Sunday. He'll be
in the bathroom for two hours.

376
00:43:01,819 --> 00:43:05,165
He will take a bath. Set his hair.
And then he will come out.

377
00:43:23,554 --> 00:43:26,304
Arvind Desai.

378
00:43:35,906 --> 00:43:37,761
Stella...

379
00:43:38,011 --> 00:43:39,927
Why don't you understand?

380
00:43:52,222 --> 00:43:53,764
I'll deal with it.

381
00:45:19,084 --> 00:45:20,375
Stella!

382
00:45:23,052 --> 00:45:26,552
Stella, Stella, Stella, Stella...

383
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:30,291
Stella!

384
00:46:03,413 --> 00:46:04,996
Here I come.

385
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,067
Let's keep this here.

386
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:16,200
They had one last vase.

387
00:46:16,287 --> 00:46:18,869
Thank you. - Doesn't it look good
on your table?

388
00:46:19,649 --> 00:46:21,232
It looks really good!

389
00:46:21,573 --> 00:46:24,781
It would get imitated soon.
- Really? - India...

390
00:46:27,312 --> 00:46:28,770
Thank you, Arvind.
- Okay.

391
00:46:34,698 --> 00:46:36,394
It is made of polyester, right?

392
00:46:38,034 --> 00:46:39,444
Fantastic.

393
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:43,246
Isn't it great?
- It's very good.

394
00:46:51,025 --> 00:46:54,897
In this country you don't even get
anything good. everything cheap and bad.

395
00:46:57,483 --> 00:46:59,932
You bought this vase
from Singapore, right?

396
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:06,510
I bought it in Singapore.
But it is from Paris.

397
00:47:06,861 --> 00:47:08,361
what a country.

398
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:13,176
Mr. D'costa, women work shoulder
to shoulder with men over there.

399
00:47:14,422 --> 00:47:16,242
In fact, they are better than men.

400
00:47:16,923 --> 00:47:20,046
It's wrong. It's absolutely wrong.

401
00:47:22,171 --> 00:47:26,863
People are very dishonest
when it comes to women.

402
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,157
Let me give you an example, uncle.

403
00:47:31,593 --> 00:47:33,821
They show glitter of money
to Christian girls.

404
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:39,636
Lure her. Trap her. They have fun
with her and also give her promotion.

405
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:44,480
When it comes to marriage,
they go back to one of theirs.

406
00:47:47,494 --> 00:47:50,911
Everyone isn't bad. Some are good,
some are bad. - Shut up.

407
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:57,032
You're just a kid.
You won't understand.

408
00:47:58,081 --> 00:48:00,068
It's a matter of pride.
- Albert, please.

409
00:48:00,581 --> 00:48:03,081
Why do you feel hurt
hearing the truth?

410
00:48:07,185 --> 00:48:10,506
Christian girls got educated,
and went to work, so then they are bad.

411
00:48:11,546 --> 00:48:13,678
People look down upon them.
I'm not lying.

412
00:48:14,894 --> 00:48:16,823
In big factories, offices,

413
00:48:16,896 --> 00:48:20,182
it was our girls who were
first to start working there.

414
00:48:20,442 --> 00:48:22,067
Isn't that a great thing?

415
00:48:24,779 --> 00:48:28,773
Now, every other girl wears
shades, jeans and pants.

416
00:48:29,722 --> 00:48:32,652
Who started this fashion
of shades, jeans and pants?

417
00:48:34,715 --> 00:48:36,382
Not everyone says that.

418
00:48:37,105 --> 00:48:40,272
Listen, I.. - Why do you think
everyone is the same? - Shut up!

419
00:48:42,537 --> 00:48:44,996
It's a matter of pride.
- Albert Pinto.

420
00:48:46,414 --> 00:48:48,333
Very profound.

421
00:48:49,737 --> 00:48:54,081
Albert, you aren't aware that
your ideas are very philosophical.

422
00:48:54,689 --> 00:48:57,490
Why not? I always say the right thing.

423
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:00,350
Very good.

424
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:05,747
Albert, the minority bill
is in news these days.

425
00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:08,519
what's your opinion?

426
00:49:09,688 --> 00:49:14,061
Mino.. Minority bill?
- Yes. - Yes, it is..

427
00:49:16,256 --> 00:49:18,185
What is that?
What kind of bill is that?

428
00:49:18,518 --> 00:49:20,226
It's about Christians.

429
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:24,125
I guess you don't know about it.

430
00:49:35,408 --> 00:49:38,308
This vase must be expensive.

431
00:49:45,093 --> 00:49:46,760
It's also very tough.

432
00:49:47,265 --> 00:49:48,682
Have a look.

433
00:49:51,473 --> 00:49:53,432
It's solid.
- Yes.

434
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,669
Unbreakable.
- Yes?

435
00:50:01,472 --> 00:50:02,764
Unbreakable?

436
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:08,291
Shall I try?

437
00:50:37,779 --> 00:50:39,154
It broke.

438
00:51:22,972 --> 00:51:24,506
Is Vivek here?

439
00:51:25,226 --> 00:51:27,975
No, he has gone out.
What do you want?

440
00:51:29,082 --> 00:51:36,456
I am Vivek's friend. He asked me
to deliver his car. I brought it.

441
00:51:39,043 --> 00:51:42,543
Oh, come in.

442
00:52:08,608 --> 00:52:09,941
Have a seat.

443
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:19,157
So, you are Vivek's friend?

444
00:52:21,726 --> 00:52:25,596
He comes to me
to get his car repaired.

445
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:32,229
So, it's your garage?

446
00:52:32,479 --> 00:52:36,366
Garage is Vishwaas Sahab's.
I am a mechanic there.

447
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:39,666
I'm the chief mechanic.

448
00:52:42,404 --> 00:52:44,342
Pass me that purse.

449
00:52:52,577 --> 00:52:54,702
How much is the bill?

450
00:52:57,572 --> 00:52:59,317
Here you are.

451
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:36,897
It's for you.
- No. No, ma'am. Take it back.

452
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:39,236
Vivek asked me to give.

453
00:53:45,714 --> 00:53:46,768
Thank you.

454
00:53:51,788 --> 00:53:54,454
Here are the keys.
Give it to Ramu outside.

455
00:54:21,356 --> 00:54:23,675
Two plates of 'mutton'.
Two plates of 'Raita'.

456
00:54:23,726 --> 00:54:26,475
Two 'Mutter Paneer'.
And some 'Paratha'.

457
00:54:26,695 --> 00:54:27,945
How many 'Parathas', sir?

458
00:54:28,029 --> 00:54:30,114
Pappu, will you have 'Paratha'?
- Yes, dad.

459
00:54:30,195 --> 00:54:32,445
Okay. Four 'Parathas'.
- Four 'Parathas'.

460
00:54:32,612 --> 00:54:34,653
Sir, we have
the best 'Malai Kofta'.

461
00:54:36,171 --> 00:54:37,630
You may add that too.

462
00:54:39,752 --> 00:54:41,028
And one Campa Cola.

463
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,153
No, Thumbs up.
- One Thumbs up.

464
00:54:43,236 --> 00:54:44,735
Pappu, son sit properly.

465
00:54:46,485 --> 00:54:49,193
Anything else, sir?
Poppadam, salad?

466
00:54:50,485 --> 00:54:53,777
Yes, bring that too.
- What are you doing?

467
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:57,109
Why did you throw sauce on him?
- Pappu, I had told you..

468
00:54:57,192 --> 00:54:59,484
..to behave while in a restaurant.

469
00:54:59,901 --> 00:55:02,192
Pappu, this is bad manners.

470
00:55:02,817 --> 00:55:04,858
It's okay. He's just a kid.
It's all right.

471
00:55:43,981 --> 00:55:46,647
All right. This time we are together.

472
00:56:05,477 --> 00:56:06,852
All right?

473
00:56:13,144 --> 00:56:15,226
Okay. We take your leave.
- Goodbye.

474
00:56:15,476 --> 00:56:17,476
Goodbye.
- Bye.

475
00:56:18,476 --> 00:56:19,809
Okay.

476
00:56:46,432 --> 00:56:50,348
Why do you worry?
Whatever will happen, let it happen.

477
00:57:04,263 --> 00:57:07,263
Albert, I think
there's a loose contact.

478
00:57:09,574 --> 00:57:13,454
I'll fix it.
- Yes, you are an expert.

479
00:57:18,198 --> 00:57:22,323
Mr. Braganza, I want to ask you
something personal.

480
00:57:23,334 --> 00:57:27,125
My girlfriend Stella.
- Yes.

481
00:57:28,334 --> 00:57:31,094
I quarrel with her every day.

482
00:57:33,312 --> 00:57:34,704
I don't know why.

483
00:57:36,508 --> 00:57:42,466
Well, I do make mistakes,
but so does she.

484
00:57:45,184 --> 00:57:49,887
Mr. Braganza, will these
quarrels stop if we get married?

485
00:57:50,673 --> 00:57:53,754
Albert, concentrate on your work.

486
00:57:54,481 --> 00:57:58,629
First, earn a lot of money.
Buy a flat, car and television.

487
00:57:59,533 --> 00:58:03,542
Think about marriage after that.
- What about the quarrels?

488
00:58:04,655 --> 00:58:07,873
Take her out to the movies.
Go out with her.

489
00:58:07,923 --> 00:58:10,955
She will be happy
and the problem will be solved.

490
00:58:12,795 --> 00:58:14,378
You're right.

491
00:58:17,097 --> 00:58:22,629
Mr. Braganza, do you think the
textile workers would go on a strike??

492
00:58:25,099 --> 00:58:29,118
Albert, I don't waste time
thinking about these things.

493
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:32,184
Let me tell you a secret.

494
00:58:32,411 --> 00:58:36,661
I am successful because
I concentrate on my work.

495
00:58:39,244 --> 00:58:42,116
You are very talented. Just like me.

496
00:58:43,135 --> 00:58:45,835
Keep working hard and
you'll be very successful.

497
00:58:47,492 --> 00:58:49,903
Don't waste your time
on these things.

498
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:53,935
Strikes are done by goons
and gangsters.

499
01:00:07,836 --> 01:00:13,336
Strikes..
politics.. everything is nonsense.

500
01:00:15,734 --> 01:00:19,234
Fucking strike, politics

501
01:00:19,869 --> 01:00:21,369
nonsense.

502
01:00:21,619 --> 01:00:23,034
All of it is nonsense.

503
01:00:30,203 --> 01:00:31,703
This is the work of goons.

504
01:00:33,291 --> 01:00:35,870
Father shouldn't
get into these things.

505
01:00:36,214 --> 01:00:38,422
Mama, why don't you explain to him?

506
01:00:39,481 --> 01:00:41,148
He is 50 years old now.

507
01:00:41,319 --> 01:00:43,549
Why does he tangled unnecessarily
into these things?

508
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,270
He should take care of the house.

509
01:00:46,264 --> 01:00:48,430
Has anyone got benefited
by doing strikes?

510
01:00:49,013 --> 01:00:50,607
Father should understand this.

511
01:00:52,323 --> 01:00:54,613
Now, look at Stella..

512
01:00:56,105 --> 01:00:58,003
Mama, how many times
have I told her..

513
01:00:59,347 --> 01:01:03,096
..not to talk to the
mechanics in the garage.

514
01:01:03,949 --> 01:01:05,535
But she doesn't listen to me.

515
01:01:06,886 --> 01:01:09,179
You don't know that
you talk to them nicely..

516
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:10,988
..but they misunderstand you.

517
01:01:11,653 --> 01:01:14,510
Do you know anything?
Anything about their house?

518
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:18,215
Mama, they wouldn't have
spoken to any (woman) other than..

519
01:01:18,266 --> 01:01:20,040
...their sisters or mothers.

520
01:01:20,491 --> 01:01:22,905
She comes to the garage
and says hello to them with a smile.

521
01:01:22,955 --> 01:01:26,445
But Albert, is there..
- Mama, I told her thousand times.

522
01:01:27,323 --> 01:01:30,034
She doesn't listen to me.
She'll talk to them with a smile.

523
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:33,444
They will think that
you are that kind of a girl.

524
01:01:36,006 --> 01:01:38,143
Do we always have to fight?

525
01:01:38,193 --> 01:01:41,263
Stella it's nothing like that.
- Arre, who wants to fight?

526
01:01:42,376 --> 01:01:44,571
I just try to explain
some things to you.

527
01:01:45,623 --> 01:01:47,358
Hopefully
you will get at least something.

528
01:01:47,409 --> 01:01:49,034
Look Albert..
- One minute, mama.

529
01:01:50,024 --> 01:01:53,650
Will you feel good that they will
think of you as that kind of a girl?

530
01:01:56,183 --> 01:01:59,411
I am that kind of a girl na?
You show me the way.

531
01:02:01,107 --> 01:02:03,696
You are always right
and I am always wrong.

532
01:02:04,533 --> 01:02:06,111
Stella..
- It is all my fault.

533
01:02:07,498 --> 01:02:09,355
Wear sari, don't wear a skirt..

534
01:02:09,639 --> 01:02:10,947
Yes..
- Laugh/don't laugh..

535
01:02:10,997 --> 01:02:13,731
Talk to this one,
don't talk to that one.

536
01:02:15,108 --> 01:02:17,893
The people you roam
around with are nice.

537
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:20,398
The people I talk to are bad.

538
01:02:21,605 --> 01:02:23,589
Why shouldn't I talk to those mechanics?

539
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:26,010
I like them.
-really

540
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:30,910
And whatever I like..
you surely won't like that.

541
01:02:32,436 --> 01:02:34,595
Stella, it's nothing like that..
it is just that he..

542
01:02:34,646 --> 01:02:35,813
Even Arvind?

543
01:02:41,254 --> 01:02:42,254
hmmmm?

544
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,373
Albert, I'm leaving.

545
01:02:55,467 --> 01:02:57,552
Albert, she is a nice girl.
Why do you fight?

546
01:02:57,603 --> 01:02:58,968
I was not fighting..
- Then what?

547
01:02:59,019 --> 01:03:00,144
I try to explain to her.

548
01:03:00,228 --> 01:03:01,727
Then go and get her back.

549
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:03,310
I won't go.

550
01:03:04,536 --> 01:03:05,536
Mama..

551
01:03:08,098 --> 01:03:09,348
Dominic is in jail.

552
01:03:12,305 --> 01:03:13,305
What?

553
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:17,025
Dominic is in jail.

554
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:20,461
He was caught while stealing.

555
01:03:34,796 --> 01:03:37,088
Pinto.. Dominic Pinto.

556
01:03:39,934 --> 01:03:42,510
Pinto...
Who is Pinot?

557
01:04:01,292 --> 01:04:02,292
You came?

558
01:04:03,675 --> 01:04:05,339
My brother has come to meet me.

559
01:04:07,701 --> 01:04:09,138
Didn't you feel ashamed?

560
01:04:11,728 --> 01:04:14,311
Look Dominic, I..
- Do you have a cigarette?

561
01:04:20,751 --> 01:04:24,552
Look I..
I thought something for you..

562
01:04:28,371 --> 01:04:31,918
When you get out of here..

563
01:04:33,597 --> 01:04:36,175
..then I can get you
admitted in the techno school.

564
01:04:36,896 --> 01:04:38,396
Back to school?

565
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:40,249
In Technical school.

566
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:46,148
If you can learn some work, some trade..
- Work, trade..

567
01:04:47,999 --> 01:04:50,296
Look Dominic,
don't make fun of what I am saying.

568
01:04:52,565 --> 01:04:56,882
I am telling you,
if you want to do some work..

569
01:04:56,933 --> 01:04:58,424
..if you want to learn some trade..

570
01:04:58,487 --> 01:05:01,351
I have learnt what I had to learn.

571
01:05:03,135 --> 01:05:06,176
There's only one thing left now.
- What?

572
01:05:09,258 --> 01:05:10,508
I won't spare Bhimiya.

573
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:17,797
Look you.. you..
you forget Bhimiya. For god's sake.

574
01:05:19,538 --> 01:05:21,289
You'll get into even more trouble.

575
01:05:23,134 --> 01:05:26,841
Here we are worried about
arranging your bail..

576
01:05:27,422 --> 01:05:30,257
Oh my, my family members are
so worried about me?

577
01:05:31,373 --> 01:05:33,250
We all are with you.

578
01:05:36,727 --> 01:05:39,352
If you want to work..

579
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,761
I promise you, I can get you a job.

580
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,764
Time for all that is over
for that now.

581
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:48,860
Thanks for trying.

582
01:05:53,071 --> 01:05:54,438
Do you have some money?

583
01:06:06,413 --> 01:06:07,413
Take this.

584
01:06:12,193 --> 01:06:13,318
Albert, do you know?

585
01:06:15,343 --> 01:06:16,984
There are three worlds here..

586
01:06:18,614 --> 01:06:22,573
..one is yours, one is mine,
and the third is jail world.

587
01:06:26,543 --> 01:06:28,306
You came here,
thanks for that.

588
01:06:29,175 --> 01:06:31,039
Dominic, listen..
I.. Dominic, listen.

589
01:06:31,122 --> 01:06:33,081
Dominic? Dominic?

590
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:40,292
Hey Dominic! Dominic!

591
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:30,319
Come here.

592
01:08:34,725 --> 01:08:37,228
Shall I order for tea?
- Yes.

593
01:08:47,358 --> 01:08:50,732
Today, laborers of cloth
mills have gone on a strike.

594
01:08:50,817 --> 01:08:52,474
This strike is not going to stop.

595
01:08:52,525 --> 01:08:57,320
All the laborers have come together
in the Lalbaugh ground in revolution.

596
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,191
They heard their leaders.

597
01:08:59,967 --> 01:09:03,724
All the workers took an oath
today that they will not go back to work

598
01:09:03,774 --> 01:09:05,985
..until their demands are fulfilled.

599
01:10:39,549 --> 01:10:41,252
'Everyone should be thrown out.'

600
01:10:41,842 --> 01:10:43,967
'Each and everyone
should be thrown out.'

601
01:10:45,717 --> 01:10:49,799
'Scoundrels, traitors.
Throw everyone out.'

602
01:10:51,190 --> 01:10:54,526
When they die of hunger,
they'll know what unemployment means.

603
01:11:02,388 --> 01:11:05,658
There's unemployment in the
country, right? I have a solution.

604
01:11:08,634 --> 01:11:09,868
Fire each and everyone.

605
01:11:10,658 --> 01:11:11,661
Hire new people.

606
01:11:12,158 --> 01:11:14,674
Thousands are unemployed;
anyone can be hired.

607
01:11:15,599 --> 01:11:19,012
These strikers will then
know that work is like god.

608
01:11:23,054 --> 01:11:24,905
They go on a strike
on every little thing.

609
01:11:24,956 --> 01:11:26,593
Work is shut,
city is shut.

610
01:11:26,644 --> 01:11:29,695
Since emergency rule has gone away,
they are doing as they please.

611
01:11:35,451 --> 01:11:37,409
They are ruining the country.

612
01:11:39,397 --> 01:11:40,397
Do you know?

613
01:11:40,497 --> 01:11:43,338
Do you know how much the country
is suffering because of strike?

614
01:11:43,389 --> 01:11:45,479
Millions, billions..

615
01:11:46,568 --> 01:11:49,590
Just see my case.. we lost
such a big order.. from Germany.

616
01:11:49,799 --> 01:11:53,212
This country needs foreign currency.
Foreign exchange.

617
01:11:56,567 --> 01:12:01,600
The union leaders make them
dance like animals.

618
01:12:02,782 --> 01:12:04,726
and they also just dance the dance.

619
01:12:05,383 --> 01:12:08,130
Each of them will be thrown,
only then they'll know.

620
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:12,395
They don't even believe in god.
Atheist assholes!

621
01:12:14,786 --> 01:12:17,369
Fucking bastards...

622
01:12:49,759 --> 01:12:50,911
Shaving kit.

623
01:12:54,185 --> 01:12:55,376
Is it necessary to shave?

624
01:12:57,317 --> 01:12:59,238
The one's on strike
should look clean.

625
01:13:02,827 --> 01:13:03,827
Why?

626
01:13:06,446 --> 01:13:08,374
He shouldn't look like
as if he has lost.

627
01:13:09,991 --> 01:13:11,033
hmmmm

628
01:13:14,589 --> 01:13:18,216
Did I lose? I? Me?
Did I lose?

629
01:13:22,881 --> 01:13:24,423
Did I lose?

630
01:13:41,954 --> 01:13:43,704
I will explain it to him.

631
01:13:47,637 --> 01:13:49,309
Stay quiet now. He is coming.

632
01:13:51,247 --> 01:13:54,260
Vinay, give me a matchbox.
- I don't have it.

633
01:13:55,712 --> 01:13:58,517
Give me a matchbox.
- I don't have it. I told you na.

634
01:14:04,028 --> 01:14:05,369
Tell me, what do you feel?

635
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:08,285
See Bhimiya,
there shouldn't be any problem.

636
01:14:08,368 --> 01:14:10,616
Brother, there won't be any problem.

637
01:14:11,267 --> 01:14:15,118
The mill owner supports me.
No one can harm us in any way.

638
01:14:16,442 --> 01:14:18,306
Moreover, we are not doing this alone.

639
01:14:18,785 --> 01:14:20,566
There are more fellows with us.

640
01:14:20,924 --> 01:14:22,669
Who?
-Kaliya is there.

641
01:14:22,867 --> 01:14:25,602
Then Chandra.
- Yes.

642
01:14:25,736 --> 01:14:28,023
And the one who stays
in Dongri.. Kania.. - Okay.

643
01:14:28,074 --> 01:14:30,072
They all are doing the same job.

644
01:14:30,123 --> 01:14:32,587
We are not to let more
than 2-3 labourers gather.

645
01:14:32,647 --> 01:14:34,022
If they gather, hit them.

646
01:14:34,105 --> 01:14:35,940
Is there money?
- You'll get lots of money.

647
01:14:35,991 --> 01:14:37,621
You'll get a lots of money.

648
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:41,467
You listen to me.
Believe me. I'm telling you.

649
01:14:42,168 --> 01:14:45,115
Okay, if I get the money,
and the owner is with us..

650
01:14:45,365 --> 01:14:48,114
..then okay.
- I'm telling the same since then.

651
01:14:48,197 --> 01:14:49,989
Let's do it.
- Yes, let's do it then.

652
01:14:52,906 --> 01:14:54,156
Let's go.

653
01:15:17,905 --> 01:15:21,499
Okay, so we have reached your home..
I brought you comfortably, right?

654
01:15:21,803 --> 01:15:24,191
Thank you.
- Arre, just wait for a minute.

655
01:15:24,645 --> 01:15:26,592
Is our relationship limited
only to work?

656
01:15:27,951 --> 01:15:30,082
Arvind, it is too late.
I shall leave.

657
01:15:30,133 --> 01:15:33,817
Look, there's no one around.
Can't we even talk?

658
01:15:36,984 --> 01:15:38,984
Talk about what?

659
01:15:39,764 --> 01:15:45,026
About us. Look Stella,
I want us both to be friends.

660
01:15:46,852 --> 01:15:49,871
Look, right now, neither
I am in the office nor your boss.

661
01:15:52,039 --> 01:15:54,948
I must ask for a little time,
nothing else.

662
01:15:57,337 --> 01:15:58,773
I want us both to be friends.

663
01:15:58,857 --> 01:16:00,732
You know what I mean? Good friends.

664
01:16:01,851 --> 01:16:04,515
Sometimes in the evenings,
we can go out or something.

665
01:16:06,962 --> 01:16:08,170
Yes.

666
01:16:09,251 --> 01:16:12,522
Don't worry.
Albert will not get to know.

667
01:16:15,598 --> 01:16:16,805
hmmmm

668
01:16:24,678 --> 01:16:29,271
You slapped me?
You bloody bitch! Get out!

669
01:16:31,495 --> 01:16:33,162
Don't come to work from tomorrow.

670
01:16:36,032 --> 01:16:39,459
Do you really believe
that you fired me?

671
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:48,102
Bitch..

672
01:17:08,769 --> 01:17:11,068
These days, our luck is very bad.

673
01:17:18,628 --> 01:17:20,295
Dominic's brother is coming.

674
01:17:21,016 --> 01:17:23,118
Is her coming here?

675
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:34,850
Hi.

676
01:17:38,069 --> 01:17:40,483
Bhimya, I was looking for you only.
- So you found me.

677
01:17:40,555 --> 01:17:42,586
Tell me,
why were you looking for me?

678
01:17:43,751 --> 01:17:46,111
Actually... Dominic...

679
01:17:47,552 --> 01:17:51,243
will be released
in a couple of days now.

680
01:17:53,857 --> 01:17:57,626
He.. I want to tell you..
look Bhimiya..

681
01:17:59,351 --> 01:18:02,454
..that guy is a bit hot headed.
- Yes.

682
01:18:03,419 --> 01:18:05,175
But he is a kid.

683
01:18:05,867 --> 01:18:09,687
Please don't fight with him..
- Why will I fight with him?

684
01:18:10,064 --> 01:18:13,967
No, my mother is very worried that
when he.. - Look, look..

685
01:18:14,544 --> 01:18:17,085
When Dominic gets released,
you explain to him.

686
01:18:17,365 --> 01:18:20,718
If he messes with me..
- No, he won't do.. he won't.

687
01:18:22,959 --> 01:18:25,173
But he is also just a kid,

688
01:18:25,282 --> 01:18:27,180
If he tells you something..
- Look, pal.

689
01:18:27,504 --> 01:18:28,921
I understand everything.

690
01:18:29,234 --> 01:18:32,009
If he is a kid,
tell him to sit on his mother's lap..

691
01:18:33,031 --> 01:18:35,841
..and drink milk. Get it?
Now, fuck off.

692
01:18:35,924 --> 01:18:39,341
Go, go.. - Yes, go..
- Trying to tell us..

693
01:18:41,072 --> 01:18:43,497
Why are you pushing me?
- Is it?

694
01:18:45,395 --> 01:18:49,458
Brother, I told you simply leave..
why are you irritating me?

695
01:18:49,684 --> 01:18:51,809
I already have problems.
- Don't push me.

696
01:18:52,252 --> 01:18:53,756
Just leave na.

697
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:55,297
What do I tell him?

698
01:19:04,345 --> 01:19:06,104
You won't go?
- Go, go.

699
01:19:14,763 --> 01:19:16,740
He says, take care of Dominic.
- Idiot.

700
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:22,253
Forget it..

701
01:19:30,003 --> 01:19:31,503
Idiot went away.

702
01:19:50,588 --> 01:19:53,344
You apologize to Arvind
and attend the office.

703
01:19:54,575 --> 01:19:57,505
He is a nice guy. He will agree.

704
01:20:03,256 --> 01:20:05,255
No, I won't go.

705
01:20:06,949 --> 01:20:09,368
You won't go?
Why not?

706
01:20:10,878 --> 01:20:12,717
What will you eat?

707
01:20:13,391 --> 01:20:15,098
We need money to run the house.

708
01:20:16,409 --> 01:20:18,076
Do you understand or not?

709
01:20:22,863 --> 01:20:24,822
Do you know why I
had a fight with Arvind?

710
01:20:27,015 --> 01:20:29,948
I don't care about that.
You go for work.

711
01:20:32,529 --> 01:20:35,677
He wants to romance with me.
He wants to trap me.

712
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:40,541
He thinks, that since I am his secretary,
he owns me

713
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:43,750
You tell me.
Should I apologize to him?

714
01:20:44,811 --> 01:20:46,436
If you say, I will go.

715
01:20:50,308 --> 01:20:52,510
It is possible that
he might not do it again.

716
01:20:53,938 --> 01:20:55,987
You are misunderstanding him.

717
01:21:00,406 --> 01:21:02,143
I know what he did.

718
01:21:02,326 --> 01:21:06,192
What did he do? I'll tell Albert right
now. He will teach him a lesson.

719
01:21:07,539 --> 01:21:11,762
No.. don't tell Albert.
-But why not?

720
01:21:13,766 --> 01:21:17,150
Albert..
even he doesn't understand me.

721
01:21:18,156 --> 01:21:19,952
Don't you like him?

722
01:21:21,557 --> 01:21:25,098
I like him..
- Then go and please talk to him.

723
01:21:26,549 --> 01:21:31,410
No, Albert will have to come to me.
I am tired.

724
01:21:53,738 --> 01:22:00,988
It runs.. car too..
his and mine too.

725
01:22:02,196 --> 01:22:10,070
"It runs..
car too.. his and mine too."

726
01:22:10,528 --> 01:22:15,110
"If it runs, it is light..
but the car is heavy."

727
01:22:15,194 --> 01:22:19,486
"This is a car worth 5 lakhs."

728
01:22:19,569 --> 01:22:23,776
"This is a car worth 5 lakhs."

729
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:27,235
"A pauper will ride in it.
- What are you saying?"

730
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:32,526
"On a weighing machine keep this on
one side and on the other, your house."

731
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:35,817
"If your wife is inside the house,
then even she's sold."

732
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:45,274
"This is a car worth 5 lakhs."

733
01:22:55,940 --> 01:22:58,023
"Wish this car belonged to me."

734
01:22:58,107 --> 01:23:00,065
"I would've had children and wife."

735
01:23:00,482 --> 01:23:03,481
"Wish this car belonged to me."

736
01:23:03,731 --> 01:23:06,981
"I would've had children and wife."

737
01:23:07,064 --> 01:23:14,333
"It is nothing about me,
but their night would be theirs."

738
01:23:14,697 --> 01:23:16,724
"Why are you crying? Hit the hammer."

739
01:23:17,085 --> 01:23:20,938
"This is a car worth 5 lakhs."

740
01:23:21,021 --> 01:23:25,478
"This is a car worth 5 lakhs."

741
01:23:25,687 --> 01:23:30,520
"I don't know what the problem is.
A palace is standing above the house."

742
01:23:30,979 --> 01:23:33,936
"I don't know what the problem is."

743
01:23:34,019 --> 01:23:37,519
"A palace is standing
above the house."

744
01:23:37,603 --> 01:23:43,768
"Uncle is dying of hunger and
the rich man's warehouse is full."

745
01:23:44,268 --> 01:23:47,476
"Tell me if anyone knows."

746
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:49,935
"What the problem is?"

747
01:23:50,018 --> 01:23:52,226
"What the problem is?"

748
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:57,184
"You, you, you, you!
May be even he doesn't know."

749
01:23:57,684 --> 01:23:59,976
"What the problem is?"

750
01:24:00,059 --> 01:24:02,267
"What the problem is?"

751
01:24:06,558 --> 01:24:10,975
"This is a car worth 5 lakhs."

752
01:24:12,932 --> 01:24:21,631
"It runs..
car too.. his and mine too."

753
01:24:21,682 --> 01:24:26,606
"If it runs, it is light..
but the car is heavy."

754
01:24:30,723 --> 01:24:34,972
"This is a car worth 5 lakhs."

755
01:24:35,055 --> 01:24:39,180
"This is a car worth 5 lakhs."

756
01:24:39,263 --> 01:24:43,304
"This is a car worth 5 lakhs."

757
01:26:06,747 --> 01:26:09,421
Dominic, finally today
I am able to meet you.

758
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:16,065
I am of course a priest,
but am your friend too.

759
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:21,555
I want to help you. Do you agree?

760
01:26:23,241 --> 01:26:28,086
I will help you, but I need your help.

761
01:26:29,805 --> 01:26:31,117
My help?

762
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:35,765
Yes, your help
so that I can help you.

763
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:39,256
Can we meet once a week?

764
01:26:41,037 --> 01:26:43,465
Oh! What's the matter?

765
01:26:45,292 --> 01:26:48,250
What happened?
Nothing, my shirt tore.

766
01:26:48,421 --> 01:26:49,421
How?

767
01:26:50,198 --> 01:26:52,740
Goons.. they had come
to call off the strike.

768
01:26:54,154 --> 01:26:55,914
Good evening, Father.
- Good evening.

769
01:26:55,965 --> 01:26:58,857
How are you?
-I am alright, but are you hurt?

770
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:02,464
He is of course hurt.
I will get hot water for you.

771
01:27:02,661 --> 01:27:05,433
No need.. this has just began..

772
01:27:06,839 --> 01:27:10,339
For now, I have just been slapped
and threatened.

773
01:27:12,303 --> 01:27:14,097
We'll get to see
much worse ahead.

774
01:27:21,081 --> 01:27:23,985
Father, can you help my father?

775
01:27:27,753 --> 01:27:30,895
What can I do? This is bloodshed.

776
01:27:31,603 --> 01:27:34,971
Who will explain to these heartless?
Who will stop this rioting?

777
01:27:35,211 --> 01:27:38,141
What can we do when everyone
has become each other's enemy?

778
01:27:39,094 --> 01:27:40,552
There's hatred everywhere.

779
01:27:42,267 --> 01:27:44,509
There's nothing like love and peace.

780
01:27:45,197 --> 01:27:46,613
What can anyone do?

781
01:27:47,476 --> 01:27:48,696
We can fight.

782
01:27:49,032 --> 01:27:52,758
No. No one has benefited
by fighting. Never.

783
01:27:57,752 --> 01:28:02,288
My father was thrashed yesterday.

784
01:28:06,622 --> 01:28:11,548
Not very badly,
but he was humiliated.

785
01:28:16,696 --> 01:28:18,113
He is really hurt.

786
01:28:21,623 --> 01:28:24,680
My father never harmed anyone,

787
01:28:24,730 --> 01:28:27,333
but even so, why did this happen to him?

788
01:28:30,053 --> 01:28:31,678
Goons thrashed him.

789
01:28:33,841 --> 01:28:35,841
What do the goons
have to do with strike?

790
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:42,474
Albert, do you remember
I had told you..

791
01:28:42,662 --> 01:28:44,935
..that the result of
a challenge is fighting?

792
01:28:45,410 --> 01:28:47,276
Do you remember?
- Yes.

793
01:28:47,749 --> 01:28:49,274
Look, now you are very stressed.

794
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:53,327
When you have cooled down,
we'll talk about this.

795
01:28:55,124 --> 01:29:00,916
Sir.. my father is
a very kind-hearted man.

796
01:29:03,130 --> 01:29:06,297
He is a very simple man.
He's never harmed anyone.

797
01:29:07,868 --> 01:29:09,285
He only demanded his rights.

798
01:29:10,821 --> 01:29:13,569
If anyone demands rights,
do they have to humiliated?

799
01:29:15,159 --> 01:29:16,851
You are telling the same thing again.

800
01:29:16,902 --> 01:29:20,402
See, has anyone got
anything with a strike?

801
01:29:21,291 --> 01:29:22,790
You don't get it?
Do you?

802
01:29:24,167 --> 01:29:27,801
This is a serious issue.
This is a very complex matter.

803
01:29:28,749 --> 01:29:31,984
One day when you are calmer,
we will surely talk about it, okay?

804
01:29:32,071 --> 01:29:33,904
Okay?
- But.. sir..

805
01:29:34,067 --> 01:29:37,567
For now, you should
go home and take rest.

806
01:29:44,384 --> 01:29:48,102
And yes, convince your father
not to get entangled in strike and all.

807
01:29:49,129 --> 01:29:51,628
Only goons and hoodlums do this.

808
01:29:52,768 --> 01:29:53,768
Got it?

809
01:30:00,497 --> 01:30:01,829
I shall leave.

810
01:30:11,646 --> 01:30:13,146
Help us!

811
01:30:13,438 --> 01:30:15,867
Help us, give us bread
for the ones in trouble.

812
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:26,999
Help us!
Give us roti, give us roti.

813
01:31:05,558 --> 01:31:07,872
Yes.. we are here from Bharat News.

814
01:31:08,922 --> 01:31:11,908
To ask our labour comrades
about the strike.

815
01:31:12,158 --> 01:31:14,685
We have to ask few
questions about the strike.

816
01:31:15,683 --> 01:31:19,297
Our strike is going on..
it is absolutely going on!

817
01:31:19,995 --> 01:31:23,495
To break the strike, the owners
are sending goons and hoodlums.

818
01:31:24,235 --> 01:31:27,407
The owner cannot break the
strike by sending goons and hoodlums.

819
01:31:28,636 --> 01:31:30,774
Apart from bonus,
what else are your demands?

820
01:31:32,235 --> 01:31:36,181
Sir, bonus is a very old debate.
Since four years.

821
01:31:37,869 --> 01:31:40,202
Government announced to give 8% bonus.

822
01:31:41,590 --> 01:31:45,451
Forget 8%,
owner is not ready to give even 4%.

823
01:31:46,414 --> 01:31:48,576
Seth (Owner) says the
company is running in loss.

824
01:31:48,627 --> 01:31:50,419
It is a lie.
Absolute lie.

825
01:31:50,495 --> 01:31:54,136
Whatever we say and whatever you listen,
will it get published in the paper?

826
01:31:54,812 --> 01:31:56,437
Yes, absolutely.

827
01:31:56,938 --> 01:31:59,271
What will you publish? Nothing.

828
01:32:00,623 --> 01:32:03,460
The mill is owned by a seth,
newspaper of another seth.

829
01:32:03,768 --> 01:32:05,987
What will they publish?
Why will they publish?

830
01:32:06,657 --> 01:32:08,419
What will they publish?

831
01:32:39,323 --> 01:32:40,905
Bring me some food.

832
01:32:46,342 --> 01:32:47,936
Shall we move from here?

833
01:32:49,490 --> 01:32:50,867
What?
- Shall we move?

834
01:32:52,051 --> 01:32:54,212
There is free place there,
if you say, we'll go and sit there.

835
01:32:54,262 --> 01:32:56,137
Shut up, drunkard.

836
01:33:01,549 --> 01:33:03,341
You brought food from home?
- Yes.

837
01:33:04,074 --> 01:33:05,407
Will you have?

838
01:33:05,851 --> 01:33:08,226
I will eat vada pao.
- It is your wish.

839
01:33:26,444 --> 01:33:28,380
Albert, come on,
your customer is here.

840
01:33:28,430 --> 01:33:30,547
Tell him that 15 more minutes
for the lunch break.

841
01:33:30,598 --> 01:33:32,000
Come on, pal. He is your old customer.

842
01:33:32,050 --> 01:33:33,996
Tell him that I will
have food and come.

843
01:33:35,209 --> 01:33:37,883
Okay.. why should I care?
You'll be in loss.

844
01:33:37,978 --> 01:33:39,019
Hey, come on,

845
01:33:39,289 --> 01:33:41,061
Can't you see he is eating.
-Go away.

846
01:33:42,104 --> 01:33:43,354
Strange.

847
01:34:20,941 --> 01:34:22,108
You've reformed.

848
01:35:11,408 --> 01:35:12,491
Stella..

849
01:35:25,365 --> 01:35:26,448
Stella..

850
01:35:27,704 --> 01:35:28,745
Stella..

851
01:35:34,697 --> 01:35:35,822
Stella, I'm sorry.

852
01:35:40,350 --> 01:35:42,603
Actually, that day..

853
01:35:45,127 --> 01:35:46,579
I'm sorry.

854
01:35:56,237 --> 01:35:57,362
Stella, I'm sorry.

855
01:35:59,585 --> 01:36:03,505
Stella, will you marry me?

856
01:36:40,347 --> 01:36:42,374
Daddy..
- Yes.

857
01:36:45,982 --> 01:36:47,232
Cheers.
- Cheers.

858
01:36:51,744 --> 01:36:54,497
In a month or two,
you'll be in Canada.

859
01:36:56,940 --> 01:36:59,231
Did you keep the other papers ready?

860
01:37:00,647 --> 01:37:01,897
Do it today itself.

861
01:37:02,688 --> 01:37:05,605
Post them in the Canadian
embassy tomorrow.

862
01:37:06,345 --> 01:37:07,845
Yeah, I will do all that.

863
01:37:09,151 --> 01:37:10,948
Seems like my thing is sorted.

864
01:37:12,815 --> 01:37:17,689
Look, until your visa doesn't come,
don't tell anyone.

865
01:37:17,775 --> 01:37:19,733
No, no.
- Keep it to yourself.

866
01:37:25,145 --> 01:37:28,373
And yes,
when will you call Alice there?

867
01:37:30,644 --> 01:37:33,227
As soon as I get a job,
Alice will be in Canada.

868
01:37:34,435 --> 01:37:36,102
I don't want to go to Canada.

869
01:37:38,823 --> 01:37:40,989
You don't want to go?
Do you want to rot here?

870
01:37:42,809 --> 01:37:44,184
Are you out of your mind?

871
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:47,065
Does our people get
any respect in India?

872
01:37:47,237 --> 01:37:48,737
Nobody cares about us.

873
01:37:50,183 --> 01:37:55,635
People are illiterates here..
useless.. good for nothing.

874
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:58,214
Wherever you go-
there are fights and quarrels.

875
01:37:59,224 --> 01:38:00,516
This place is not ours.

876
01:38:01,641 --> 01:38:03,224
Johnny is right.

877
01:38:04,432 --> 01:38:06,349
India has gone to the shits.

878
01:38:07,556 --> 01:38:10,070
Canada.. now that's a place.

879
01:38:11,253 --> 01:38:14,543
Every person
has first class flat,

880
01:38:14,699 --> 01:38:19,191
car, TV, fridge,
food and drinks..

881
01:38:19,847 --> 01:38:21,180
Everything is A class.

882
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:24,847
It is a Christian country.

883
01:38:27,388 --> 01:38:29,013
We have some respect there.

884
01:38:36,513 --> 01:38:38,345
We'll know only after we go there.

885
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:43,476
This is Akashvani Bombay.

886
01:38:43,526 --> 01:38:45,290
Now, you will hear news
from Madhukar Pandey.

887
01:38:45,341 --> 01:38:47,553
The elections of the Colaba district
Panchayat (Village council)

888
01:38:47,603 --> 01:38:49,321
will be held after 2 months.

889
01:38:49,636 --> 01:38:53,511
The governor of Andhra Pradesh,
inaugurated the Filmcity in Hyderabad.

890
01:38:54,011 --> 01:38:56,969
Today is the 15th day of
the cloth mills strike in Bombay.

891
01:38:57,065 --> 01:38:59,463
There has been no resolution
in the talks between

892
01:38:59,514 --> 01:39:01,669
..the labour union
and the owners association.

893
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:04,042
A spokesperson of the owner's
association told us that..

894
01:39:04,093 --> 01:39:06,868
.. there are batches of laborers
who are now returning to work.

895
01:39:06,939 --> 01:39:11,064
He even said that there are chances of
the strike being called off in few days.

896
01:39:15,342 --> 01:39:17,216
It is a lie.. everything is lie.

897
01:39:17,655 --> 01:39:21,197
What did he say-the spokesperson
at the mill.. he is lying.

898
01:39:21,758 --> 01:39:23,966
He is lying to break our resolve.

899
01:39:34,078 --> 01:39:35,119
Albert..

900
01:39:40,131 --> 01:39:42,589
Until today I didn't tell you
why I am on strike.

901
01:39:44,339 --> 01:39:48,633
It's okay papa..
- I will tell you.. I will tell you.

902
01:39:50,755 --> 01:39:53,234
I have worked for 28 years on
those mill machines.

903
01:39:53,697 --> 01:39:56,369
The noise of the machine
is internalised in my head.

904
01:39:57,227 --> 01:39:59,912
For 28 years I worked
my ass off.

905
01:40:01,223 --> 01:40:04,074
Even when living became
difficult, I stayed silent.

906
01:40:07,169 --> 01:40:08,752
I don't know why I stayed silent.

907
01:40:11,565 --> 01:40:13,307
I had to take care of the family.

908
01:40:16,322 --> 01:40:18,486
I had to raise the children.

909
01:40:20,168 --> 01:40:24,960
Maybe that's why I remained
silent and kept working.

910
01:40:31,171 --> 01:40:33,046
What all we went through..

911
01:40:35,094 --> 01:40:38,134
We didn't get to live with respect
still I remained silent.

912
01:40:40,982 --> 01:40:44,818
Who knows,
maybe I was just a coward.

913
01:40:47,790 --> 01:40:50,998
Owners are not ready to fulfill
even our very small demands.

914
01:40:53,747 --> 01:40:56,913
Now after 28 years,
I have raised my voice.

915
01:40:58,103 --> 01:40:59,686
It is after a long time.

916
01:41:01,254 --> 01:41:03,657
Now I am not going to back down.

917
01:41:05,831 --> 01:41:08,663
I don't know what I will
get by doing strike, but..

918
01:41:09,497 --> 01:41:14,413
..one thing I am sure of
is that I have to fight.

919
01:42:04,408 --> 01:42:07,560
This my chest here na,
cotton has got into it.

920
01:42:09,150 --> 01:42:10,650
There is cotton inside.

921
01:42:11,199 --> 01:42:17,198
The doctor told me that I have
got TB, but I still have to work.

922
01:42:19,488 --> 01:42:22,405
My eyes are just filled
with the mill's smoke.

923
01:42:23,238 --> 01:42:26,738
Wherever I see, I can
just see black.

924
01:42:30,655 --> 01:42:33,186
Till I have these hands,
I have the job,

925
01:42:34,179 --> 01:42:37,279
if it gets severed,
there will be no food.

926
01:42:37,529 --> 01:42:39,404
Do you know the value of this hand?

927
01:42:40,071 --> 01:42:45,695
The hands that work on machine
are worth only Rs. 2000. Rs. 2000.

928
01:42:46,695 --> 01:42:50,075
This is my house.
Everything I have is here.

929
01:42:50,779 --> 01:42:52,987
Eating, sleeping, everything
is here only.

930
01:42:54,403 --> 01:42:57,069
Wherever you see here there's garbage.

931
01:42:58,111 --> 01:43:01,024
Do human beings live like this?

932
01:43:15,755 --> 01:43:17,942
Excuse me,
what is your name?

933
01:43:18,192 --> 01:43:20,109
Ramchander Babbar.
- Where are you from?

934
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:21,983
Satara. Why?

935
01:43:22,317 --> 01:43:24,567
I was looking for someone.
- Who?

936
01:43:25,150 --> 01:43:26,816

01:43:52,678 --> 01:43:54,280
My name is Albert Pinto.

949
01:44:09,210 --> 01:44:12,502
25th day of strike by the
laborers of Mumbai textile mill.

950
01:44:12,895 --> 01:44:14,687
More than 65 mills are shut.

951
01:44:14,854 --> 01:44:18,240
Chair of the
Bombay millowners association,

952
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:20,104
Seth Chandumal Podar..

953
01:44:20,186 --> 01:44:22,606
..has opined about the
strike in an interview.

954
01:44:23,091 --> 01:44:27,340
Our country is the biggest sufferer
because of this strike.

955
01:44:28,810 --> 01:44:32,060
The government has incurred
a loss of more than 6 crores.

956
01:44:32,893 --> 01:44:35,559
And at such time, when our country..
- Bloody liar.

957
01:44:35,642 --> 01:44:39,392
..is in dire need
of foreign currency.

958
01:44:42,434 --> 01:44:45,475
We need bread.
- Call it off.

959
01:44:46,766 --> 01:44:50,683
Talk about the countries where
the labor can't go on a strike.

960
01:44:52,308 --> 01:44:55,599
There's so much of
production and happiness.

961
01:44:57,140 --> 01:44:59,015
There should be similar
laws here too.

962
01:44:59,921 --> 01:45:02,233
Then why don't you go there?
- Progress of country..

963
01:45:02,307 --> 01:45:04,599
Why are you dying here?
- Albert!

964
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:09,145
Who is responsible for the strike?

965
01:45:10,576 --> 01:45:14,323
The leaders of the trade union.
This has become their profession.

966
01:45:16,311 --> 01:45:18,634
We were considering
labourers demands.

967
01:45:19,420 --> 01:45:20,920
We were soon going to decide.

968
01:45:21,722 --> 01:45:23,763
It takes two years to consider?

969
01:45:24,272 --> 01:45:25,272
Hey,

970
01:45:28,215 --> 01:45:30,520
The result... strike.

971
01:45:32,242 --> 01:45:36,307
Ours... country's... labourers...
everyone's loss.

972
01:45:38,345 --> 01:45:40,720
See what all is getting
effected by the strike.

973
01:45:41,970 --> 01:45:45,677
Small scale industries that
are linked to textile mills..

974
01:45:46,010 --> 01:45:47,343
..they are closed down.

975
01:45:47,677 --> 01:45:50,469
Laborers are sitting idle there.
- I see.

976
01:45:50,664 --> 01:45:52,438
He is talking about the laborers now..

977
01:45:52,489 --> 01:45:55,018
Hey, please remain silent.
We have come to see the picture.

978
01:45:55,093 --> 01:45:57,676
You see.. you see.. everyone see it.

979
01:45:57,759 --> 01:45:59,301
Make a fool out of yourself.

980
01:45:59,634 --> 01:46:00,842
Brothers, he is lying.

981
01:46:00,926 --> 01:46:03,006
Shut up.
- What happened to him?

982
01:46:05,383 --> 01:46:08,343
Do you know how much
wage does a mill laborer earn?

983
01:46:13,092 --> 01:46:14,924
Rs. 800.
- All lies!

984
01:46:15,111 --> 01:46:16,541
Hey, shut up.

985
01:46:16,591 --> 01:46:20,799
After working hard for 20 years, do you
know how much a laborer gets? Rs. 800.

986
01:46:20,882 --> 01:46:22,623
Shut up.
- You, shut up.

987
01:46:22,674 --> 01:46:24,548
Hey, enough now. Stay quiet.
- Go out.

988
01:46:24,627 --> 01:46:27,652
Hey, enough is enough.

989
01:46:30,506 --> 01:46:34,838
I think you don't even know
that the laborers who are on strike..

990
01:46:35,547 --> 01:46:39,505
..are taking the help of goons and
stopping the people who want to work.

991
01:46:41,339 --> 01:46:42,880
What nonsense?

992
01:46:42,964 --> 01:46:46,338
Will you stay quiet or not..
- They have hired goons..

993
01:47:10,138 --> 01:47:13,012
How many times should I tell you,
not to allow such people.

994
01:47:13,628 --> 01:47:15,566
I'm telling you, there's still time.

995
01:47:16,242 --> 01:47:18,579
If the labourer leaders accept
their fault.

996
01:47:19,639 --> 01:47:21,139
and call off the strike

997
01:47:21,668 --> 01:47:24,334
..then we will surely
consider laborers demands.

998
01:47:26,292 --> 01:47:29,709
We are not enemies of
the laborers like these leaders.

999
01:47:30,625 --> 01:47:32,375
Laborers are our friends.

1000
01:47:33,625 --> 01:47:35,874
We are partners in progress.

1001
01:49:05,494 --> 01:49:09,941
What makes Albert Pinto angry?
